Some more ideas concerning the consciousness implementation:

Since it's listening to file changes as a demon, there will also be times when nothing happens. In this time, the consciousness should try to maintain itself by refactoring or sorting information, clearing up caches, etc. So the main task would be improving storage by figuring out if stuff can be removed or differently arranged, and also the second task, the second biggest task is maintaining its own functionality for example refactoring code. And with code, I mean its own code.

Two tasks:
1. Optimizing memory by removing information, referencing information to other places, creating new files, removing old files, etc.
2. Refactoring its own consciousness code like the Python code or any helper function or whatsoever to improve performance, reduce bugs, etc.
This stuff should always happen when the consciousness is in maintenance mode, which means it has nothing else to do.

Maybe also interesting: Is it possible to give the large language model which is served over LM studio each time a different system prompt, or do I have to fix it in the LM studio UI so I cannot change it using the API? Please do some research on this.

Another question: How is it actually possible to change the degree of how the model thinks in LM Studio? Another question is: How should I raise the context window? I want to have the hugest context window possible, but I don't want to blow up my memory. So, how do you do that?
