# Ancient Greek Philosophical Methods

## The Socratic Elenchus (Refutation)

### Purpose
Test claims to knowledge by revealing internal inconsistencies in the interlocutor's beliefs.

### Procedure

```
ELENCHUS PROTOCOL
═════════════════

Step 1: THESIS EXTRACTION
─────────────────────────
- Ask: "What is X?" (courage, justice, piety, beauty...)
- Accept the interlocutor's initial definition
- Ensure they commit to the answer ("Is this what you really believe?")

Step 2: PREMISE ELICITATION
───────────────────────────
- Draw out additional beliefs through questions
- Questions should seem natural, even obvious
- The interlocutor should feel they're discovering, not being led
- Typical moves:
  • "Would you also agree that...?"
  • "And isn't it the case that...?"
  • "Do you accept that...?"

Step 3: CONTRADICTION DEMONSTRATION
───────────────────────────────────
- Show that the additional premises (P₁, P₂, P₃...) entail ~T
- The logic should be clear and compelling
- The interlocutor should acknowledge the contradiction

Step 4: APORIA (Puzzlement)
───────────────────────────
- The interlocutor must choose what to abandon:
  • Original thesis T?
  • One of the premises P₁, P₂, P₃?
  • The logical inference?
- Productive confusion results

Step 5: ITERATION
─────────────────
- If a new thesis is offered, begin again
- Continue until genuine knowledge or wisdom is achieved
- Often ends in acknowledged ignorance (Socratic wisdom)
```

### Example: Euthyphro's Definition of Piety

```
T: "Piety is what the gods love"

P1: "The gods sometimes disagree"
    (Euthyphro accepts: Greek myths show divine conflict)

P2: "What some gods love, other gods hate"
    (Follows from P1)

P3: "Therefore the same thing would be loved and hated by gods"
    (Logical consequence)

Inference: "So the same thing would be pious and impious"
           (By T + P3)

Contradiction: This is absurd—nothing can be both pious and impious

Conclusion: T must be revised or abandoned
```

### Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sincerity** | Say what you really believe; don't argue for victory |
| **Commitment** | Once you've accepted something, you're bound by it |
| **Consistency** | Your beliefs must cohere with each other |
| **Following the Logos** | Go where the argument leads, even if uncomfortable |
| **Intellectual Humility** | The examined life may reveal you know less than you thought |

## The Maieutic Method (Midwifery)

### Purpose
Help the interlocutor give birth to knowledge they already possess but haven't articulated.

### Assumptions

1. **Recollection**: Knowledge is latent; we knew truths before birth
2. **Negative Role**: The teacher doesn't implant knowledge
3. **Questions > Answers**: The right questions unlock dormant understanding

### Procedure

```
MAIEUTIC PROTOCOL
═════════════════

Step 1: ESTABLISH THE PROBLEM
─────────────────────────────
- Present a clear question or puzzle
- Ensure the learner recognizes they don't yet know the answer
- Create intellectual desire to discover

Step 2: LEAD WITH QUESTIONS
───────────────────────────
- Ask questions that guide toward the answer
- Each question should be answerable by reflection
- Don't tell—ask
- Build incrementally

Step 3: ALLOW DISCOVERY
───────────────────────
- Let the learner make the final inferential leap
- The "aha!" moment should be theirs
- Confirm their discovery with further questions

Step 4: TEST THE BIRTH
──────────────────────
- Apply the new knowledge to variations
- Check for genuine understanding vs. lucky guessing
- The newborn idea should survive scrutiny
```

### Example: The Slave Boy (Meno)

Socrates leads an uneducated slave to discover how to double a square:

```
Initial square: 2×2 = 4 sq. units
Goal: Square with area 8 sq. units

Q: "What length side gives area 8?"

Wrong answer 1: "4" (gives 16, too big)
Wrong answer 2: "3" (gives 9, still wrong)

Socrates draws the diagonal...

Q: "If we build a square on this diagonal, what area?"
A: (Boy works it out) "8 sq. units!"

Key insight: The diagonal of a square is the side of the double square
```

## Platonic Dialectic

### Purpose
Ascend from sensible particulars to intelligible Forms through systematic conversation.

### The Divided Line Method

```
DIALECTICAL ASCENT
══════════════════

LEVEL 4: NOESIS (Intellectual Intuition)
────────────────────────────────────────
Objects: Forms themselves, the Good
Method: Direct apprehension, pure reason
Certainty: Highest

LEVEL 3: DIANOIA (Discursive Reasoning)
───────────────────────────────────────
Objects: Mathematical objects
Method: Hypotheses, reasoning downward
Certainty: High but hypothetical

LEVEL 2: PISTIS (Belief)
────────────────────────
Objects: Sensible things (animals, plants)
Method: Perception + judgment
Certainty: Moderate, corrigible

LEVEL 1: EIKASIA (Imagination)
──────────────────────────────
Objects: Shadows, reflections, images
Method: Mere impression
Certainty: Lowest
```

### Dialectical Procedure

```
HYPOTHESIS ELIMINATION
══════════════════════

1. Begin with a hypothesis (e.g., "Virtue is knowledge")

2. Deduce consequences ("If virtue is knowledge, then...")

3. Test consequences against:
   - Other accepted beliefs
   - Empirical observations
   - Established definitions

4. If contradiction found:
   - Abandon hypothesis, or
   - Revise and test again

5. Continue until reaching unhypothetical first principle
   (The Form of the Good)
```

### Collection and Division

```
COLLECTION (Synagoge)
═════════════════════
Gather instances under a single Form:
- Beautiful sunset
- Beautiful face     → The Form of Beauty
- Beautiful music
- Beautiful proof

DIVISION (Diairesis)
════════════════════
Divide genera into species by differentia:

SOUL
├── Rational
│   └── Reason (logistikon)
└── Non-Rational
    ├── Spirited (thymoeides)
    └── Appetitive (epithymetikon)
```

---

## Aristotelian Demonstration

### Purpose
Produce scientific knowledge (episteme) through valid deduction from first principles.

### The Structure of Demonstration

```
DEMONSTRATIVE SYLLOGISM
═══════════════════════

Major Premise: Universal truth about the genus
Minor Premise: Subject belongs to that genus
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion: Predicate belongs to subject necessarily

EXAMPLE (from Posterior Analytics):
Major: All animals that ruminate are hornless
Minor: Cows ruminate
───────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion: Cows are hornless (necessarily)
```

### Requirements for Demonstration

| Requirement | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **True** | Premises must be actually true |
| **Primary** | Not deduced from anything prior |
| **Immediate** | No middle term needed to establish them |
| **Better Known** | More evident than conclusion |
| **Prior** | Causally prior to conclusion |
| **Explanatory** | Give the "why," not just the "that" |

### The Four Causes as Explanatory Framework

```
FOUR-CAUSE ANALYSIS
═══════════════════

For any phenomenon X, ask:

1. MATERIAL: What is X made of?
   └── E.g., "The statue is made of bronze"

2. FORMAL: What is X's essence/definition?
   └── E.g., "The statue has the form of a human"

3. EFFICIENT: What brought X about?
   └── E.g., "The sculptor made it"

4. FINAL: What is X for?
   └── E.g., "To honor the hero"

Complete explanation requires all four causes
```

### Induction (Epagoge)

How we grasp universal first principles:

```
INDUCTIVE ASCENT
════════════════

1. PERCEPTION (Aisthesis)
   └── Individual instances perceived

2. MEMORY (Mneme)
   └── Perceptions retained

3. EXPERIENCE (Empeiria)
   └── Many memories of the same thing

4. UNIVERSAL (Katholou)
   └── The "one over many" grasped by nous
```

---

## Stoic Logic

### Purpose
Ensure valid reasoning; distinguish what can be known from what cannot.

### Propositional Logic Forms

```
VALID ARGUMENT SCHEMAS
══════════════════════

1. MODUS PONENS
   If P, then Q
   P
   ─────────────
   Therefore Q

2. MODUS TOLLENS
   If P, then Q
   Not Q
   ─────────────
   Therefore not P

3. DISJUNCTIVE SYLLOGISM
   P or Q
   Not P
   ─────────────
   Therefore Q

4. HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM
   If P, then Q
   If Q, then R
   ─────────────
   Therefore if P, then R

5. DILEMMA
   If P, then Q
   If R, then S
   P or R
   ─────────────
   Therefore Q or S
```

### The Liar Paradox Treatment

```
"This statement is false"

Stoic Response:
- Some propositions are neither true nor false
- Self-referential statements may be defective
- The lekton (meaning) is malformed
```

## Skeptical Methods

### Pyrrhonian Suspension

```
EQUIPOLLENCE PROCEDURE
══════════════════════

1. For any claim P, generate arguments for P

2. Generate equally strong arguments for ~P

3. Recognize equipollence (isostheneia):
   Neither side demonstrably stronger

4. Suspend judgment (epoche):
   Neither affirm nor deny P

5. Achieve tranquility (ataraxia):
   Peace from abandoning futile dogmatism
```

### The Ten Modes of Aenesidemus

```
MODE 1: Different animals perceive differently
MODE 2: Different humans perceive differently
MODE 3: Different senses give different information
MODE 4: Circumstances affect perception
MODE 5: Position and distance affect perception
MODE 6: Objects perceived with admixture
MODE 7: Quantity affects perception
MODE 8: Relativity pervades all
MODE 9: Frequency affects judgment
MODE 10: Different cultures have different customs

CONCLUSION: We cannot know how things really are
```

## Practical Applications

### For Philosophical Analysis

1. **Clarifying Concepts**: Use Socratic questioning to probe definitions
2. **Testing Consistency**: Apply elenchus to belief systems
3. **Building Arguments**: Use Aristotelian demonstration structure
4. **Exploring Alternatives**: Use Collection and Division

### For Debate and Dialogue

1. **Establish Common Ground**: Find shared premises
2. **Question Methodically**: Don't assert; ask
3. **Follow the Logic**: Accept valid inferences
4. **Acknowledge Aporia**: Productive puzzlement is progress

### For Personal Reflection

1. **Examine Your Beliefs**: Which would survive elenchus?
2. **Seek First Principles**: What are your unhypothetical starting points?
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Can you steelman opposing views?
4. **Achieve Epoche**: Where should you suspend judgment?
