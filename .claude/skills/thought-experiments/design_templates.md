## Design Strategies

### Strategy 1: Amplification
**Goal**: Push a feature to an extreme to reveal its implications

**Template**:
```
Take [concept X] and imagine it at [maximum/minimum/extreme degree].
What follows?
```

**Example**: Philosophical Zombies
- Feature: Consciousness
- Extreme: Complete absence (while physics unchanged)
- Result: Tests whether consciousness is entailed by physics

**Recipe**:
1. Identify the feature of interest
2. Ask: What if this were completely absent/present/extreme?
3. Stipulate that everything else remains normal
4. Ask what we should say about this case

---

### Strategy 2: Isolation
**Goal**: Remove confounding factors to isolate single variable

**Template**:
```
Create a scenario where [variable X] is present/absent
while [all confounding variables Y, Z, W] are controlled.
```

**Example**: Mary's Room
- Variable: First-person experience of color
- Controlled: All physical/functional knowledge
- Result: Tests whether experience adds anything beyond physics

**Recipe**:
1. Identify what you want to test
2. List all factors that normally correlate with it
3. Design scenario where correlates are held constant
4. Vary only the target variable

---

### Strategy 3: Transposition
**Goal**: Move a feature to an unfamiliar context to reveal assumptions

**Template**:
```
Take [feature/process X] that normally occurs in [context A]
and imagine it occurring in [context B].
```

**Example**: Chinese Room
- Feature: Symbol manipulation / following rules
- Normal context: Computer running program
- New context: Person in room following rulebook
- Result: Reveals that we don't attribute understanding to mere rule-following

**Recipe**:
1. Identify a process we want to understand
2. Find a context where we have clear intuitions
3. Transpose the process to that context
4. Check if intuitions transfer

---

### Strategy 4: Reversal
**Goal**: Invert the usual arrangement to test its necessity

**Template**:
```
Imagine [relationship/property X] reversed:
Where normally A→B, imagine B→A (or A→not-B).
```

**Example**: Inverted Qualia
- Normal: Red things cause "red" experiences
- Reversed: Red things cause experiences that would normally be "green"
- Result: Tests whether qualia are tied to their functional roles

**Recipe**:
1. Identify a relationship assumed to be necessary
2. Imagine it reversed
3. Ask if the reversal is coherent
4. If coherent, what does this show about the relationship?

---

### Strategy 5: Gradual Series (Sorites)
**Goal**: Challenge sharp boundaries by creating continuous spectrum

**Template**:
```
Create a series of cases from [clear case A] to [clear case B]
with minimal differences between adjacent cases.
```

**Example**: Gradual neuron replacement
- Start: Fully biological you
- End: Fully silicon replica
- Series: Replace neurons one at a time
- Result: Challenges sharp boundary for personal identity

**Recipe**:
1. Identify the boundary you want to test
2. Find clear cases on either side
3. Design intermediate cases with minimal steps
4. Challenge: Where does the boundary fall?

---

### Strategy 6: Fission/Fusion
**Goal**: Test identity by splitting or merging entities

**Template**:
```
Take [entity X] and imagine it [splitting into two / merging with Y].
Which result is [identical to / continuous with] the original?
```

**Example**: Teletransporter fission
- Entity: A person
- Operation: Create two copies, destroy original
- Question: Which copy is "you"? Both? Neither?
- Result: Identity may not be all-or-nothing

**Recipe**:
1. Identify entity whose identity you want to test
2. Design splitting or merging operation
3. Ask about identity of results
4. Explore implications for identity conditions

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Testing Moral Responsibility

**Target**: Free will is required for moral responsibility

**Strategy**: Isolation (remove alternative possibilities)

**Design Process**:
1. We want to test: "Could have done otherwise" is necessary for responsibility
2. Create case where someone couldn't have done otherwise but seems responsible
3. Introduce a "counterfactual intervener" who WOULD have made them act the same way

**Result**: Frankfurt Cases

```markdown
## The Unwitting Assassin

### Scenario
Jones is deliberating whether to kill Smith. Unbeknownst to Jones,
a neuroscientist has implanted a device in Jones's brain. If Jones
decides NOT to kill Smith, the device will activate and make Jones
kill Smith anyway. As it happens, Jones decides on his own to kill
Smith. The device never activates.

### Key Stipulations
1. Jones deliberates and decides entirely on his own
2. The device would have made him act the same way if needed
3. The device never actually activates
4. Jones has no awareness of the device

### The Question
Is Jones morally responsible for killing Smith?

### Target
The Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP):
A person is morally responsible only if they could have done otherwise.

### Expected Responses
- **Response A: Yes, Jones is responsible**
  He decided on his own; the counterfactual intervener is irrelevant.
  - Implication: PAP is false; actual sequence matters, not alternatives

- **Response B: No, Jones is not responsible**
  He couldn't have done otherwise; the device's presence undermines responsibility.
  - Implication: PAP is true; even unactivated backup removes responsibility

### Variants
| Variant | Change | What It Tests |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Active device | Device activates, does the work | Clearly not responsible—baseline |
| Partial activation | Device influences but doesn't determine | Degrees of responsibility |
| Natural counterfactual | A heart attack would have killed Smith anyway | Natural vs. artificial backup |
```

### Example 2: Testing Personal Identity

**Target**: Psychological continuity is sufficient for personal identity

**Strategy**: Fission

**Design Process**:
1. Create case of perfect psychological continuity
2. But with branching (two continuers)
3. If identity requires uniqueness, psychological continuity isn't sufficient

**Result**: Fission Case

```markdown
## The Duplicator

### Scenario
You step into a machine that creates two perfect copies of you—
same memories, personality, values, brain states. Both copies
emerge simultaneously. The original is destroyed in the process.

### Key Stipulations
1. Both copies are psychologically continuous with you
2. The copies are equally good continuers (no asymmetry)
3. Both emerge at the same time (no priority)
4. The original does not survive the process

### The Question
Which copy (if either) is YOU?

### Target
Psychological continuity theory of personal identity

### Expected Responses
- **Response A: Both are you**
  - Implication: Identity can branch; "you" now refers to two people
  - Problem: Transitivity of identity violated (A=C, B=C, but A≠B)

- **Response B: Neither is you**
  - Implication: Something beyond psychology is needed (e.g., uniqueness)
  - Problem: What if one copy fails? Suddenly the other is you?

- **Response C: One is you (but indeterminate which)**
  - Implication: Identity facts can be metaphysically indeterminate
  - Problem: Seems ad hoc

- **Response D: Question is confused (Parfit)**
  - Implication: "Survival" isn't all-or-nothing; what matters is continuity
  - Lesson: Personal identity isn't what matters

### Variants
| Variant | Change | What It Tests |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Asymmetric copies | One copy is slightly better match | Does degree matter? |
| Original survives | Three people: original + two copies | Branching with survival |
| Sequential | First copy, then second copy | Does temporal priority matter? |
```
