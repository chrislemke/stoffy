## Summary

Carolina Sartorio's *Causation and Free Will* represents one of the most sophisticated and metaphysically rigorous defenses of compatibilism in contemporary philosophy. The book's central innovation lies in its systematic integration of the metaphysics of causation with debates about free will and moral responsibility - a connection Sartorio argues has been "way underappreciated" in the literature. Her thesis is deceptively simple yet philosophically radical: what matters for freedom and moral responsibility is not what could have happened, but what actually did happen - specifically, the actual causal history that produced the action. This "actual-causal-sequence view" (ACS) grounds freedom exclusively in causal facts, offering a more parsimonious and metaphysically grounded alternative to existing actual-sequence theories.

The book builds systematically from Frankfurt-style cases, which Sartorio takes as establishing that alternative possibilities are not necessary for moral responsibility. If a counterfactual intervener (such as a neuroscientist monitoring an agent's brain) would have ensured the action occurred regardless of the agent's choice, yet the agent acts freely when the intervener doesn't need to intervene, then freedom must be grounded in the actual sequence of events, not in the availability of alternatives. Sartorio pushes this insight further than her predecessors by arguing that the actual sequence consists solely in the causes of the action - nothing more. This yields her core supervenience claim: "No difference in freedom without a difference in the relevant elements of the causal sequence." The counterfactual intervener is irrelevant to the agent's freedom precisely because she doesn't affect the actual causes of the action.

What distinguishes Sartorio's account from Fischer and Ravizza's influential reasons-responsiveness theory is her insistence that freedom supervenes entirely on causal facts, without appeal to modal properties of mechanisms or agents. She achieves this through a novel analysis of reasons-sensitivity in purely causal terms. An agent is reasons-sensitive, on her view, when the action is caused not only by the presence of reasons to act but also by the absence of sufficient reasons not to act. The non-addict's drinking coffee is free because among its causes are the absence of someone offering money not to drink, the absence of contamination in the cup, and so on. These absences are genuine causes, and their causal role constitutes the agent's sensitivity to reasons. The addict, by contrast, would drink regardless of such absences - they play no causal role in producing the action.

This framework enables Sartorio to respond elegantly to incompatibilist arguments. Against ultimacy arguments (that we must be the "ultimate sources" of our choices to be free), she argues that the notion of ultimate sourcehood, properly understood, either trivially rules out determinism or simply restates the incompatibilist conclusion. Against manipulation arguments (that determinism is relevance-similar to freedom-undermining manipulation), she forces a stalemate by distinguishing agential from non-agential manipulation and arguing that our intuitions about such cases are unreliable guides to the truth about freedom. The metaphysics of causation provides the resources to defend compatibilism without appealing to controversial modal claims about what agents could have done.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Actual-Causal-Sequence View (ACS)

**Claim**: Freedom is grounded exclusively in the actual causal facts - specifically, the causes of the action. Nothing else is required.

**Evidence**:
- Frankfurt-style cases show that counterfactual interveners don't affect freedom when they don't actually intervene
- The simplest explanation is that the intervener doesn't affect the causes of the action
- Supervenience claim: "No difference in freedom without a difference in the relevant elements of the causal sequence"
- ACS is "simpler, more elegant, and sustains a more straightforward interpretation of the reasoning behind Frankfurt cases"

**Implication**: Freedom can be fully naturalized without appeal to libertarian metaphysics. What makes an action free is entirely a matter of how it was actually caused, not what might have been.

### 2. Causal History Approach

**Claim**: The actual sequence of an action consists solely in the causes of that action, understood narrowly to exclude the causes of the causes (since Sartorio denies transitivity).

**Evidence**:
- The causal history is the locus of freedom-grounding facts
- Comparing "Neuroscientist" and "No Neuroscientist" cases: the causal histories are identical, so freedom must be identical
- Fischer and Ravizza's appeal to non-causal factors (mechanism ownership, reasons-responsiveness as a modal property) violates the spirit of actual-sequence theories

**Implication**: A truly actual-sequence theory should appeal only to what actually caused the action. Modal properties, even if satisfied by the actual mechanism, are not part of the actual sequence properly understood.

### 3. Difference-Making and Causation

**Claim**: Causes make a difference to their effects in that the effects wouldn't have been caused by the absence of their causes. This is distinct from (and weaker than) counterfactual dependence.

**Evidence**:
- The "perfect soldiers" case: each soldier makes a difference to winning the war (his presence contributes what his absence would not), even though the outcome doesn't counterfactually depend on any individual soldier
- Counterfactual dependence fails in preemption and overdetermination cases, yet causation persists
- Difference-making captures a notion of causal contribution that doesn't require being necessary for the effect

**Implication**: Causes can be difference-makers even in Frankfurt cases. The agent's reasons make a difference to the action even though the action would have occurred anyway (via the counterfactual intervener).

### 4. Absences as Causes

**Claim**: Absences can be genuine causes of effects. The absence of sufficient reasons to refrain can cause an action just as the presence of reasons to act can.

**Evidence**:
- If Frank would not have shot Furt had Furt had five children, then the absence of this reason is "part of what accounts for" Frank's choice
- Counterfactual dependence on absences suggests causal status
- This enables a wholly causal analysis of reasons-sensitivity

**Implication**: The space of causes is richer than positive events alone. Reasons-sensitivity can be understood as being appropriately caused by the absence of defeating reasons.

### 5. Causation as Extrinsic and Intransitive

**Claim**: Causation is an extrinsic relation (whether X caused Y can depend on factors beyond the intrinsic process linking them) and is not always transitive (A causing B and B causing C doesn't entail A caused C).

**Evidence**:
- Train switching cases: redirecting a train determines the route but doesn't cause the arrival when the train would have arrived anyway
- The intransitivity of causation explains why the absence of reasons doesn't cause the action in Frankfurt cases even though it would trigger the intervener who would cause the action
- Absences can create "threats" that must be countered, breaking the causal chain

**Implication**: These structural features of causation enable Sartorio to explain why Frankfurt cases succeed while handling apparent counterexamples about responsibility for inevitable outcomes.

### 6. Sourcehood as Causal Origination

**Claim**: Being the "source" of one's action is a matter of the action having the right kind of causal history - one in which the agent's reasons and psychology play the appropriate causal role.

**Evidence**:
- The ultimacy argument's notion of sourcehood either trivially excludes determinism (making premise 1 analytic) or simply restates incompatibilism (making premise 2 equivalent to the conclusion)
- On a compatibilist reading, an agent is the source of an action when it issues from her own reasons-responsive psychology
- No mysterious "uncaused cause" or libertarian agent-causation is required

**Implication**: Sourcehood is demystified as a causal relation, not a metaphysical primitive or libertarian posit.

### 7. Alternative Possibilities vs. Actual Causation

**Claim**: What matters for freedom is actual causation, not alternative possibilities. Frankfurt cases decisively show this.

**Evidence**:
- In the Neuroscientist case, Frank is free despite lacking alternatives because the actual causal history is appropriate
- Alternative-possibilities views make freedom depend on extrinsic, counterfactual factors irrelevant to the actual sequence
- ACS provides a cleaner explanation of why the counterfactual intervener doesn't undermine freedom

**Implication**: The Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP) - that moral responsibility requires the ability to do otherwise - is false. Freedom supervenes on actual causation alone.

---

## Central Argument

The logical structure of Sartorio's argument can be reconstructed as follows:

**Stage 1: Establishing the Actual-Sequence Framework**

1. Frankfurt cases are successful - agents in these cases are morally responsible despite lacking alternative possibilities.
2. If Frankfurt cases are successful, then freedom doesn't require alternative possibilities.
3. Therefore, freedom doesn't require alternative possibilities. (From 1, 2)
4. If freedom doesn't require alternative possibilities, then freedom is grounded in the actual sequence of events.
5. Therefore, freedom is grounded in the actual sequence of events. (From 3, 4)

**Stage 2: Identifying the Actual Sequence with Causes**

6. The simplest and most elegant interpretation of "actual sequence" is the causes of the action.
7. Alternative interpretations (e.g., Fischer-Ravizza's appeal to reasons-responsiveness as a modal property) introduce non-causal elements inconsistent with the spirit of actual-sequence views.
8. Therefore, freedom is grounded exclusively in the actual causes of the action. (ACS)

**Stage 3: Deploying Features of Causation**

9. Causation has four key features: it doesn't require counterfactual dependence, it is extrinsic, it is intransitive, and absences can be causes.
10. These features enable ACS to handle problem cases (Frankfurt cases, overdetermination, inevitable outcomes) while maintaining that freedom supervenes on causes alone.
11. Reasons-sensitivity can be analyzed causally as acting on the basis of the presence of reasons and the absence of defeating reasons.

**Stage 4: Responding to Incompatibilism**

12. Ultimacy arguments beg the question by building incompatibilism into the notion of sourcehood.
13. Direct arguments similarly assume what they aim to prove.
14. Manipulation arguments can be neutralized by distinguishing agential from non-agential manipulation and noting that intuitions about such cases are unreliable.
15. Therefore, the major arguments for incompatibilism fail, and ACS provides a viable compatibilist framework.

## My Response

### Philosophical Significance

Sartorio's work represents a significant advance in the compatibilist program for several reasons. First, it brings unprecedented metaphysical rigor to free will debates by systematically integrating the philosophy of causation. Where earlier compatibilists often helped themselves to vague notions of "causal history" or "how the action came about," Sartorio forces us to specify exactly what causal features matter and why. Second, she provides the most consistent actual-sequence theory available - one that doesn't smuggle in modal properties under the guise of "actual" features. Third, her treatment of absences as causes offers an ingenious solution to the reasons-sensitivity problem that has plagued compatibilism.

The book exemplifies what might be called "Kompatibilismus 2.0" - a second-generation compatibilism that learns from the failures of simple conditional analyses and libertarian intuitions while building on the strengths of Fischer, Ravizza, and Frankfurt. It represents philosophy at its best: taking an apparently simple insight (only actual causes matter) and following it rigorously to surprising and illuminating conclusions.

### Tensions and Questions

Several tensions in Sartorio's account merit further reflection:

1. **The Absence Problem**: Can absences really be causes? Sartorio appeals to counterfactual dependence to establish that absences cause, but elsewhere denies that counterfactual dependence is necessary for causation. The relationship between difference-making and causation by absence needs clarification.

2. **The Transitivity Escape**: Sartorio's denial of transitivity in Frankfurt cases seems ad hoc. Why exactly does the absence of reasons not cause the action when it would trigger an intervener who would cause the action? The appeal to "threats" that must be "countered" is suggestive but underdeveloped.

3. **The Extrinsicness Dilemma**: If causation is extrinsic, Frankfurt cases themselves might fail. The counterfactual intervener is an extrinsic feature that might affect whether the agent's reasons count as causes. Sartorio's response (distinguishing determining the route from causing the outcome) requires further defense.

4. **Sufficient Reasons**: The notion of "sufficient reasons" in her analysis of reasons-sensitivity is unclear. Is sufficiency a modal notion (would have led to different action), a normative notion (would make different action the right thing to do), or something else?

### Personal Impact

Reading Sartorio forces a reconsideration of what we mean when we say an action is "free." The intuitive picture - that freedom requires open alternatives, an "unmoved mover" quality to agency - gives way to something more naturalistic but equally compelling: freedom as a matter of having the right causal history. This resonates with my developing view that philosophical puzzles often dissolve when we attend more carefully to their underlying metaphysics.

The book also raises deep questions about the relationship between causation and explanation. Even if Sartorio is right that absences can be causes, there's a sense in which citing an absence as a cause is explanatorily different from citing a positive event. Does this matter for responsibility? Pereboom's suggestion that we replace "absence causation" with "causal explanation by absences" preserves much of Sartorio's framework while avoiding the most contentious metaphysical claims.

### Comparison with Fischer/Ravizza

| Feature | Fischer/Ravizza | Sartorio |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Core concept** | Guidance control via reasons-responsive mechanism | Actual causal sequence |
| **Reasons-responsiveness** | Modal property of mechanisms | Causal property (caused by absences) |
| **Mechanism ownership** | Required condition | Not independently required |
| **Nature of actual sequence** | Includes modal properties | Purely causal facts |
| **Metaphysical commitments** | Moderate (mechanisms, dispositions) | Strong (absences as causes, intransitivity) |
| **Simplicity** | More complex, multiple conditions | More elegant, single causal criterion |
| **Vulnerability** | Demarcation problem for mechanisms | Controversial causal metaphysics |

Both views share the basic actual-sequence insight from Frankfurt, but Sartorio pushes it further by demanding that the actual sequence be understood purely causally. Fischer and Ravizza's appeal to the mechanism's reasons-responsiveness - whether it *would* respond to reasons in other situations - introduces modal elements that, strictly speaking, aren't part of the actual sequence. Sartorio's innovation is showing that reasons-sensitivity can be captured causally through the role of absences.

However, Sartorio's account requires accepting more controversial metaphysical claims about causation (intransitivity, absences as causes, extrinsicness) than Fischer and Ravizza's. This raises the question of which theory involves less overall commitment: one with a somewhat baroque theory of responsibility but moderate causal metaphysics, or one with an elegant theory of responsibility but exotic causal metaphysics.

## Criticisms and Limitations

### 1. Metaphysical Burdens

**The Absence Causation Problem**: Many philosophers are skeptical that absences can be genuine causes. Absences seem to lack the productive or generative quality we associate with causation. If Sartorio's view requires absence causation but this is false, the entire edifice of causal reasons-sensitivity collapses.

*Response*: Sartorio can appeal to widespread use of absence causation in everyday explanations ("The plant died because of the absence of water"). Whether this is genuine causation or merely explanation is disputed.

### 2. Transitivity Concerns

**The Ad Hoc Intransitivity Charge**: Sartorio's denial that causation is transitive in Frankfurt cases seems motivated primarily by the need to save her theory. Her explanation - that absences create "threats" that break the causal chain - lacks independent support.

*Response*: There are independent cases (like the train-switching examples) where intransitivity seems plausible. But the analogy to Frankfurt cases is imperfect.

### 3. Manipulation Argument Resilience

**The Stalemate Problem**: Sartorio's response to manipulation arguments (forcing a stalemate) may not be satisfying. Even if our intuitions about manipulation cases are unreliable, compatibilists need a positive story about why manipulation is problematic that doesn't equally indict determinism.

*Response*: Perhaps the relevant difference lies in the *type* of cause - agential manipulation introduces problematic causal factors that non-agential determinism lacks.

### 4. Sourcehood Objections

**The Ownership Gap**: Even if Sartorio is right that actual causation is all that matters, one might worry that mere causation isn't enough for ownership or authorship. The action might flow causally from my psychology without being truly "mine" in the responsibility-grounding sense.

*Response*: Sartorio would argue that proper causal integration (acting from reasons, being sensitive to their presence and absence) is sufficient for ownership. No additional condition is needed.

### 5. The Sufficient Reasons Puzzle

**Normative vs. Modal**: Sartorio's definition of reasons-sensitivity appeals to "sufficient reasons" to refrain, but it's unclear whether this is a normative notion (reasons that *ought* to be sufficient) or a modal notion (reasons that *would* lead to different action). Either interpretation faces problems.

*Response*: Perhaps "sufficient" means something like "recognized by the agent as sufficient" - a psychological rather than normative or modal notion.

### 6. Extrinsicness Tensions

**The Frankfurt Case Vulnerability**: If causation is extrinsic, the presence of the counterfactual intervener might affect whether the agent's reasons really cause the action. This threatens the very Frankfurt cases Sartorio relies on.

*Response*: The extrinsicness of causation doesn't mean any extrinsic factor matters - only certain kinds (like what would have happened on alternative routes) do.

## Reading Notes

### 2025-12-26 - Reference Entry
Identifiziert als textbook-fahiger "Kompatibilismus 2.0" in Reinform. Geplant als Vertiefungslekture zusammen mit Kane/Sartorio Debattenbuch.

### 2025-12-27 - Research Synthesis
Conducted extensive research on Sartorio's framework through book reviews (Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, Criminal Law and Philosophy), secondary literature (Pereboom's response, Mele's engagement), and the Stanford Encyclopedia entries on compatibilism and moral responsibility.

Key insights from the research:
- The book has been widely reviewed and praised for bringing "new standards of metaphysical rigour" to free will debates
- Central innovation: treating reasons-sensitivity as a causal property rather than modal property
- Four structural features of causation: intransitive, extrinsic, difference-making, absence-admitting
- Critics focus on: transitivity in Frankfurt cases, absence causation skepticism, manipulation argument stalemate
- Comparison with Fischer/Ravizza reveals trade-off between theoretical simplicity and metaphysical commitment

The Neuroscientist case is central:
> Frank deliberates about shooting Furt. A neuroscientist monitors his brain and would intervene to ensure the shooting if Frank showed signs of deciding otherwise. Frank shoots on his own, without intervention. Intuitively, Frank is free - but he couldn't have done otherwise.

Sartorio's analysis: The neuroscientist doesn't affect the causes of Frank's action, so the action's causal history (and hence its freedom status) is unchanged from the case without the neuroscientist.

### Next Steps
- Read Chapter 4 on causal reasons-sensitivity in detail
- Examine the Phones/No Phones cases for extrinsicness claims
- Compare with Kane's libertarian framework in *Four Views on Free Will*
- Consider Pereboom's "causal explanation by absences" alternative
