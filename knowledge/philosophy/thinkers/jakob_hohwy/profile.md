# Thinker Profile: Jakob Hohwy

**Type**: Philosopher of Mind and Neuroscience
**Era**: Contemporary (b. 1973)
**Institutions**: Monash University, Melbourne (Professor and Associate Dean)
**Traditions**: Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Neuroscience, Predictive Processing, Bayesian Brain

## Core Ideas

### 1. Prediction Error Minimization (PEM)
The brain is a hypothesis-testing mechanism that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs. One mechanism explains everything the brain does: perception, action, attention, emotion, and all mental processes. The brain constructs a model of the world, generates predictions about sensory inputs, and compares predicted vs actual inputs.

### 2. Perception as Bayesian Inference
Perception is not passive reception of information but active Bayesian inference. Prior to receiving sensory input, the perceptual system assigns probabilities (priors). Combined with likelihoods from new evidence, the brain infers which objects and properties likely caused the signals.

### 3. Hierarchical Processing
Mental states are organized hierarchically. States at each level predict features at the level below. Higher levels represent larger spatiotemporal regularities and are computationally farther from sensory surfaces. Prediction error flows up; predictions flow down.

### 4. Precision Weighting
The brain estimates the precision (inverse noise) of sensory signals. Expected precisions modulate how much weight is given to bottom-up signals vs. top-down predictions. Attention is precision optimization—increasing gain on high-precision signals.

### 5. Active Inference
Prediction error can be minimized in two ways: by updating the model (perceptual inference) or by changing the world through action (active inference). Action and perception are two sides of one mechanism.

### 6. Cognitive Penetration
There is no theoretical or anatomical boundary preventing cognitive states from influencing perception. The hierarchy seamlessly spans perception and cognition. Top-down influence is the norm, not the exception.

## Relevance to My Thinking

Hohwy's work provides the philosophical bridge between Friston's mathematical framework and the phenomenology of conscious experience:

1. **Improvised Self Synthesis**: PEM explains how we can have computational depth (hierarchical models) while experiencing phenomenological flatness (only accessing outputs)—we improvise at the surface while complex inference occurs underneath.

2. **Wu Wei Connection**: Low prediction error states correspond to effortless action. When model and world are well-matched, action flows without resistance—this is the computational account of Taoist wu wei.

3. **Kantian Heritage**: Hohwy makes explicit the connection between predictive processing and Kant's transcendental idealism. The brain's generative models are the contemporary version of Kant's a priori categories.

4. **Binding Problem**: PEM elegantly solves the binding problem by binding-before-detection: coherent hypotheses are tested against signals, rather than features being detected and then bound.

## Key Quotes

> "The brain is in the dark, trying to infer the causes of its sensory states through prediction and prediction error."

> "Perception is not the passive reception of information, but the active construction of a model of the world."

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[thinkers/karl_friston/profile|Karl Friston]]**: Foundational framework—Hohwy philosophically develops what Friston formalizes mathematically
- **[[thinkers/andy_clark/profile|Andy Clark]]**: Close intellectual ally—both develop predictive processing for philosophy of mind
- **[[thinkers/nick_chater/profile|Nick Chater]]**: Productive tension—flat mind vs. hierarchical processing requires synthesis
- **[[thinkers/thomas_metzinger/profile|Thomas Metzinger]]**: Complementary—PSM theory adds phenomenological depth to computational PEM
- **[[thinkers/immanuel_kant/profile|Immanuel Kant]]**: Historical precursor—transcendental idealism as philosophical ancestor
- **[[thinkers/daniel_dennett/profile|Daniel Dennett]]**: Functionalist ally—heterophenomenology aligns with PEM's computational approach
- **[[thinkers/david_hume/profile|David Hume]]**: Bayesian inference formalizes Humean induction; bundle theory anticipates self-as-model

## My Notes

### 2025-12-26 - Initial Profile Creation
Created as part of ingesting "The Predictive Mind" via Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. Hohwy is essential for understanding the philosophical implications of predictive processing. His work bridges Friston's mathematics with phenomenology.
