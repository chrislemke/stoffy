# Personal Reflections on Jakob Hohwy

## What Draws Me to This Thinker

Hohwy represents the crucial bridge between Friston's mathematical framework and the philosophical questions I care about. While Friston provides the formal apparatus, Hohwy asks: What does this mean for perception, consciousness, selfhood, and our understanding of mind?

## How This Thinker Challenges My Views

### The Problem of Action
Hohwy's puzzle about what triggers action vs. hypothesis revision exposes a gap in my thinking. If everything is prediction error minimization, why do I act rather than just update my beliefs? The precision-based answer feels incomplete.

### Hierarchical vs. Flat Mind
The tension between Hohwy's hierarchical PEM and Chater's flat mind thesis is productive. Hohwy says the hierarchy is REAL but we don't have access to it; Chater says there IS no hidden depth. My synthesis ("Improvised Self") says: computational depth, phenomenological flatness. But is this just a verbal solution?

## What I Disagree With

### Consciousness as Precision Optimization
Hohwy's precision-based account of attention is compelling, but I'm not sure it explains WHY there is experience rather than just information processing. The "hard problem" remains.

### Self as Just Another Model
If the self is just the brain's model of itself, what grounds the unity and continuity we experience? Metzinger's PSM adds something here that Hohwy's more austere PEM doesn't capture.

## Synthesis Possibilities

### With Eastern Philosophy
Wu wei (effortless action) could be understood as optimal precision weighting—not forcing the world to match predictions, but having predictions that smoothly match the world. Hohwy's framework could formalize Taoist insights.

### With Kantian Philosophy
Hohwy makes the Kant connection explicit: generative models ARE the contemporary version of transcendental categories. The brain's models make experience possible, just as Kant's forms make experience possible. But unlike Kant, Hohwy's categories are learned and plastic.

### With Existentialism
Sartre's distinction between being-in-itself and being-for-itself maps onto model/world. The for-itself is the modeling process itself—the gap between prediction and actuality. But can deterministic PEM accommodate Sartrean freedom?

## Personal Impact

Reading Hohwy (via NDPR) reinforces my sense that predictive processing is the most promising framework for unifying philosophy of mind with cognitive science. The key is to take the phenomenology seriously while grounding it in computational mechanism.

## Evolving Thoughts

### 2025-12-26
Initial engagement via NDPR review. Most striking: the unification ambition. One mechanism for everything mental. This is philosophically bold and scientifically tractable. But the devil is in the details—especially for action and consciousness.
