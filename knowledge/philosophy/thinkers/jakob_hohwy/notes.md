# Notes on Jakob Hohwy

## Key Concepts to Remember

### Prediction Error Minimization (PEM)
- Brain = hypothesis-testing mechanism
- One mechanism for everything: perception, action, attention, binding
- Minimize difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs
- Model of the world generates predictions tested against reality

### The Hierarchy
- Lower levels: small spatiotemporal scales (edges, local motion)
- Higher levels: larger spatiotemporal scales (objects, persistence)
- Predictions flow DOWN; prediction error flows UP
- Only unexplained residuals propagate upward

### Precision and Attention
- Precision = inverse of noise (1/variance)
- Brain estimates expected precision of signals
- Attention = precision optimization
- High-precision signals get more weight in inference

### Active Inference (Action)
- Two ways to minimize prediction error:
  1. Perceptual inference: update the model
  2. Active inference: change the world
- Action makes the world match predictions
- Perception and action are two sides of same coin

## Open Questions

1. **What triggers action vs. hypothesis revision?**
   - Hohwy's solution involves expected precision of counterfactual states
   - But this seems incomplete—how do counterfactual predictions initiate real action?

2. **Hierarchical ordering problem**
   - Ordering A: computational distance from sensory surfaces
   - Ordering B: spatiotemporal scale of represented regularities
   - These may conflict for beliefs (far from surfaces but about small scales)

3. **Cognitive impenetrability**
   - If no boundary between cognition and perception, why are some illusions recalcitrant?
   - Hohwy's answer: low noise = low-level processing dominates
   - But footsteps illusion shows noise-based account is incomplete

## Connections to My Thoughts

- **Improvised Self**: PEM provides computational mechanism for Chater synthesis
- **Wu Wei and Free Energy**: Low prediction error = effortless action
- **Existential Potentiality**: Prediction/actuality gap = formal potentiality
- **Kompatibilismus 2.0**: Active inference as mechanism for reasons-responsive agency
