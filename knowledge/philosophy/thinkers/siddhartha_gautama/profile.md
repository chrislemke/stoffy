# Thinker Profile: Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha)

**Type**: philosopher
**Era**: ancient (c. 563-483 BCE or c. 480-400 BCE)
**Traditions**: Buddhism

## Core Ideas

- **The Four Noble Truths**: Life involves suffering (dukkha); suffering arises from craving; cessation of suffering is possible; the path to cessation is the Eightfold Path
- **The Noble Eightfold Path**: Right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration
- **The Middle Way**: Avoiding extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification; balanced approach to spiritual practice
- **Dependent Origination (Pratityasamutpada)**: All phenomena arise in dependence upon causes and conditions; nothing exists independently
- **Anatta (Non-Self)**: There is no permanent, unchanging self or soul; the self is a process, not a thing
- **Impermanence (Anicca)**: All conditioned phenomena are impermanent; attachment to the impermanent causes suffering
