## Biography

### Early Life and Family
Aristotle was born in 384 BCE in Stagira, Chalcidice (modern northern Greece), about 55 km east of Thessaloniki. His father, Nicomachus, was personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon and belonged to the medical guild of Asclepiadae – likely sparking Aristotle's lifelong interest in biology and empirical investigation. His mother, Phaestis, came from Chalcis in Euboea. Both parents died when Aristotle was young, and he was raised by his guardian Proxenus of Atarneus.

### The Academy (367-347 BCE)
At age seventeen, Aristotle traveled to Athens to study at Plato's Academy, the preeminent institution of learning in the Greek world. He remained there for twenty years until Plato's death in 347 BCE. Though deeply influenced by Plato, Aristotle developed increasingly independent philosophical views, famously declaring "Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth." When Plato's nephew Speusippus succeeded as head of the Academy, Aristotle left for Assos in Asia Minor.

### Tutor to Alexander (343-335 BCE)
In 343 BCE, Philip II of Macedon summoned Aristotle to Pella to tutor his thirteen-year-old son, the future Alexander the Great. Little is known about the content of this education, but Philip showed his gratitude by rebuilding Stagira, which he had previously destroyed. The relationship between Aristotle and Alexander later cooled, but Aristotle's influence on Alexander's intellectual development was significant.

### The Lyceum (335-323 BCE)
In 335 BCE, Aristotle returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lyceum, near a grove sacred to Apollo Lykeios. As a metic (resident alien), he could not own property and rented the space. The school included a gymnasium and a covered walkway (peripatos), giving his followers the name "Peripatetics." The Lyceum became a major research institution, conducting systematic investigations in botany, biology, logic, music, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, physics, metaphysics, psychology, ethics, politics, rhetoric, and the arts. According to ancient accounts, it assembled one of the first great libraries of antiquity.

### Personal Life
Aristotle married Pythias, niece of his friend Hermias, ruler of Atarneus. They had a daughter, also named Pythias. After his wife's death, Aristotle lived with Herpyllis of Stagira, with whom he had a son, Nicomachus – for whom the *Nicomachean Ethics* is named.

### Death
When Alexander the Great died in 323 BCE, anti-Macedonian sentiment surged in Athens. Aristotle was charged with impiety (the same charge that had condemned Socrates). He famously fled the city "lest the Athenians sin twice against philosophy." He died in Chalcis, Euboea, in 322 BCE at age sixty-two, reportedly of a stomach ailment.

## Core Ideas

- **Virtue Ethics and the Golden Mean**: Excellence (arete) lies in the mean between excess and deficiency. Courage is the mean between cowardice and recklessness; generosity between miserliness and prodigality. Character virtues (ethike arete) are developed through habit and practice, not merely knowledge.

- **Eudaimonia**: The highest human good is *eudaimonia* – flourishing or well-being achieved through virtuous activity of the soul in accordance with reason over a complete life. "One swallow does not make a summer."

- **Four Causes**: Every thing can be fully explained through four causes: (1) Material cause – what it's made of; (2) Formal cause – its structure or essence; (3) Efficient cause – what brought it about; (4) Final cause (telos) – its purpose or goal. Teleology is fundamental to understanding nature.

- **Hylomorphism**: All substances are composites of matter (hyle) and form (morphe). The soul is the form of the body – not a separate substance but the organizing principle that makes a living thing what it is.

- **Potentiality and Actuality (Dynamis/Energeia)**: Change is the actualization of potentiality. A block of marble is potentially a statue; the sculptor actualizes this potential. The Unmoved Mover is pure actuality (energeia) – thought thinking itself.

- **Syllogistic Logic**: Developed the first formal system of deductive logic. The syllogism – e.g., "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal" – remained the foundation of logic until the 19th century.

- **Categories**: Developed a systematic classification of being into ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, and passion.

- **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)**: The intellectual virtue required for ethical action – the capacity to deliberate well about what conduces to the good life. Different from theoretical wisdom (sophia).

## Key Works

Aristotle is credited with approximately 200 treatises, of which about 31 survive. His works are traditionally divided into: logical works (Organon), physical/scientific works, metaphysics, ethics and politics, and rhetoric/poetics.

| Work | Category | Key Contribution |
|------|----------|------------------|
| *Categories* | Logic (Organon) | Ten categories of being; substance and accident |
| *Prior Analytics* | Logic (Organon) | Formal theory of the syllogism; deductive inference |
| *Posterior Analytics* | Logic (Organon) | Scientific demonstration; knowledge from first principles |
| *Physics* | Natural Philosophy | Nature, change, causation, the infinite, place, time, motion |
| *De Anima* (On the Soul) | Natural Philosophy | Soul as form of body; faculties of perception, imagination, intellect |
| *Historia Animalium* | Biology | Systematic zoology; comparative anatomy; over 500 species described |
| *Metaphysics* | First Philosophy | Being qua being; substance; the Unmoved Mover; thought thinking itself |
| *Nicomachean Ethics* | Ethics | Virtue ethics; eudaimonia; the golden mean; friendship |
| *Politics* | Politics | Forms of government; the polis; "man is a political animal" |
| *Rhetoric* | Rhetoric | Persuasion; ethos, pathos, logos; topics and enthymemes |
| *Poetics* | Aesthetics | Theory of tragedy; catharsis; mimesis; unity of action |

### Scientific Contributions

Charles Darwin wrote in 1882: "Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle." Aristotle was the first to systematically treat botany, zoology, anatomy, embryology, teratology, and physiology. He dissected over 50 species and was the first to distinguish cetaceans from fish.

## Relevance to My Thinking

Aristotle's concepts of potentiality and actuality (dynamis/energeia) directly inform my exploration of "Existentielle Potenzialität." His teleological worldview – that everything has a purpose toward which it strives – provides a classical counterpoint to modern mechanistic explanations. The concept of eudaimonia as activity rather than a state resonates with process-oriented thinking. His hylomorphism anticipates contemporary discussions about the relationship between matter and form, body and mind.

The Aristotelian emphasis on habit and practice in moral development connects to computational approaches to self-formation: we become what we repeatedly do. His practical wisdom (phronesis) – knowing how to act in particular situations – remains relevant to debates about AI ethics and the limits of rule-based systems.
