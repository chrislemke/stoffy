# Thinker Profile: Nagarjuna

**Type**: philosopher, Buddhist monk
**Era**: medieval (c. 150-250 CE)
**Traditions**: Madhyamaka Buddhism, Mahayana

## Core Ideas

- **Sunyata (Emptiness)**: All phenomena are empty of inherent existence (svabhava); nothing has independent, intrinsic nature
- **Dependent Origination**: Everything arises in dependence on causes and conditions; emptiness is the meaning of dependent origination
- **Two Truths Doctrine**: Conventional truth (vyavaharika) and ultimate truth (paramartha); both are valid at their own level
- **Middle Way (Madhyamaka)**: Avoiding the extremes of eternalism (things exist inherently) and nihilism (things don't exist at all)
- **Prasanga**: Reductio ad absurdum arguments showing internal contradictions in opponents' positions
- **Emptiness of Emptiness**: Even emptiness is empty; it is not a higher reality but a therapeutic concept

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| Mulamadhyamakakarika | c. 2nd century CE | Root Verses on the Middle Way; foundational text on emptiness |
| Vigrahavyavartani | c. 2nd century CE | Defense against critics; epistemological issues |
| Ratnavali | c. 2nd century CE | Advice to a king; practical ethics and emptiness |

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "Whatever is dependently co-arisen, that is explained to be emptiness." - Mulamadhyamakakarika 24.18

> "Emptiness wrongly grasped is like picking up a snake by the wrong end." - Mulamadhyamakakarika

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha)**: Developed Buddha's teaching on dependent origination into full philosophy of emptiness
- **Chandrakirti**: Later Madhyamaka philosopher who wrote important commentary on Nagarjuna
- **Wittgenstein**: Some scholars see parallels in therapeutic approach to philosophy
- **Derrida**: Comparisons drawn with deconstruction's critique of presence
