# Thinker Profile: Simone de Beauvoir

**Type**: Philosopher, Writer, Social Theorist, Feminist
**Era**: Contemporary (1908-1986)
**Traditions**: Existentialism, Phenomenology, Feminism

## Core Ideas

- **"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman"**: Gender is not a biological destiny but a social construction. Femininity is created through cultural practices, expectations, and constraints imposed upon female bodies.

- **Woman as Other**: In patriarchal society, man is the Subject, the absolute, while woman is defined as the Other - the inessential, the deviation from the male norm. This structures all aspects of women's existence.

- **Ethics of Ambiguity**: Moral life involves navigating genuine ambiguity rather than seeking absolute certainties. Freedom must be willed for oneself and for others; authentic existence requires commitment to collective liberation.

- **Situated Freedom**: While existentially free, we are always embedded in concrete situations (body, history, social position) that condition but do not determine our possibilities. Freedom is exercised within constraints.

- **Bad Faith and Oppression**: Oppression works partly through the internalization of subordinate status. Women often participate in their own oppression through accepting myths of femininity and denying their freedom.

- **The Body as Situation**: The female body is not destiny but a situation to be lived and transcended. Embodiment shapes experience without determining it, and must be understood phenomenologically.

## Relevance to My Thinking

## Key Quotes

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: Lifelong intellectual partner whose existentialist philosophy she developed and in some ways surpassed, particularly in ethics and social theory.

- **Maurice Merleau-Ponty**: Fellow existentialist-phenomenologist with whom she engaged on questions of embodiment and perception.

- **Soren Kierkegaard**: Early existentialist influence whose emphasis on individual existence and choice shaped her philosophical development.

- **Mary Wollstonecraft**: Earlier feminist precursor whose vindication of women's rights anticipated some of Beauvoir's themes about gender as social construction.
