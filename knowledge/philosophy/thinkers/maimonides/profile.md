# Thinker Profile: Moses Maimonides (Rambam)

**Type**: philosopher, rabbi, physician
**Era**: medieval (1135/1138-1204 CE)
**Traditions**: Jewish Philosophy, Rationalism, Aristotelianism

## Core Ideas

- **Negative Theology**: We can only say what God is not, not what God is; divine attributes describe what God is not
- **Thirteen Principles of Faith**: Core tenets of Jewish belief including God's existence, unity, incorporeality, and prophecy
- **Reconciliation of Faith and Reason**: Philosophy and Torah are compatible; apparent conflicts require reinterpretation
- **The Golden Mean**: Virtue lies in the middle path between extremes (parallel to Aristotle)
- **Prophecy**: Natural phenomenon occurring when intellectual and imaginative faculties are perfected
- **Practical Wisdom**: Knowledge should guide ethical action; the goal of philosophy is to know God
