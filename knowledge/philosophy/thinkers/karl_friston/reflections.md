# Reflections on Karl J. Friston

Use this file for deeper engagement with Friston's ideas and their implications for my own thinking.

## Agreements

Where I find Friston's ideas compelling:

- **Unified framework**: The ambition to explain all of cognition with one principle is admirable and (surprisingly) seems to work. This is the kind of deep unification that marks genuine scientific progress.

- **Relational definition of self**: Markov blankets provide exactly what I've been looking for—a formal way to define identity without substance metaphysics. The self IS its boundary, its capacity for relation.

- **Action-perception symmetry**: The dissolution of the perception/action divide aligns with my process-oriented metaphysics. We are not passive observers of a world but active participants in it.

- **Existence as prediction**: The claim that organisms exist by predicting their sensory states resonates with my potentiality-first ontology. To exist is to engage with possibility-space.

- **Epistemic value**: The inclusion of curiosity and uncertainty reduction in the expected free energy formula is elegant. It explains why organisms explore, not just exploit.

## Disagreements

Where I diverge from or question Friston's views:

- **Phenomenological gap**: The FEP explains behavior but seems to leave out subjective experience. Where is the redness of red in the mathematics? This is the hard problem, and Friston doesn't solve it.

- **Is FEP falsifiable?**: Critics argue that FEP is so general that anything can be redescribed as free energy minimization. If it explains everything, does it explain anything?

- **Determinism implications**: If all behavior is FE minimization, free will seems to vanish. I'm developing the Voluntas-Kränkung thesis, but I'm not yet sure I want to embrace full determinism.

- **Markov blanket arbitrariness**: Who decides where the Markov blanket is? Different observers might draw it differently. Is this observer-dependence a feature or a bug?

## Open Questions

Questions that remain after engaging with Friston's work:

- [ ] How does consciousness fit into the FEP? - Is it an emergent property of sufficiently complex inference?
- [ ] Can FEP and flat mind be reconciled? - This is crucial for my project
- [ ] What are the ethical implications of viewing all behavior as FE minimization? - Does it undermine responsibility?
- [ ] How do Markov blankets scale? - Can societies have Markov blankets? What about ecosystems?

## Influence on My Worldview

Friston has transformed how I think about existence and selfhood:

1. **Mathematical ontology**: The FEP suggests that existence can be formalized mathematically. This opens the possibility of a formal metaphysics—ontology as applied mathematics.

2. **Relational identity**: Markov blankets provide the formal grounding I've been seeking for relational ontology. The self is not a thing but a boundary—a pattern of interaction.

3. **Potentiality formalized**: Free energy can be understood as the formal expression of potentiality. The space of possible model updates IS the possibility-space.

4. **Process metaphysics**: Active inference supports a view where beings are not substances but processes. To exist is to be doing active inference; to stop is to dissolve.

## Ongoing Dialogue

### 2025-12-26 - Markov Blankets and Existentielle Potenzialität

The connection between Markov blankets and my graph ontology is striking:

| My Framework | FEP Framework |
|--------------|---------------|
| Node (entity) | System with Markov blanket |
| Edge (relation) | Statistical dependencies across blanket |
| Function bundle | Generative model |
| Edge dynamics | Free energy gradient flow |

This suggests a formal translation between my philosophical framework and Friston's neuroscience. The question is: Which is more fundamental? Is the FEP a special case of potentiality metaphysics, or is my metaphysics a philosophical gloss on the FEP?

**Tentative answer**: They are complementary. The FEP provides the mathematical formalism; potentiality metaphysics provides the philosophical interpretation. Neither reduces to the other.

### 2025-12-26 - Consciousness and Free Energy

The hard problem remains. Friston's framework explains what the brain does but not what it's like to be a brain. However, there are hints:

- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT) connection**: Some researchers are exploring links between FEP and IIT. If integrated information is what consciousness is, and FEP describes how information is integrated...

- **Self-modeling**: Active inference requires self-modeling—the organism must have a model of itself within its model of the world. This self-representation might be the seed of self-awareness.

- **Temporal depth**: Planning requires modeling future states. This temporal extension might generate the felt sense of a continuous self persisting through time.

These are speculative, but they suggest that the FEP framework might eventually address consciousness, even if it doesn't yet.
