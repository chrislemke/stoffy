# Thinker Profile: Michel Foucault

**Type**: philosopher
**Era**: Contemporary (1926-1984)
**Traditions**: Post-structuralism, Continental Philosophy, French Nietzscheanism

## Core Ideas

- **Power-Knowledge (Pouvoir-Savoir)**: Power and knowledge are inseparable; knowledge is not neutral but produced within power relations. Those who control knowledge production exercise power, and power relations determine what counts as truth.

- **Discourse Analysis**: Social reality is constructed through discourse - systems of thought, language, and practice that shape what can be said, thought, and done in a given era. Discourses define the boundaries of knowledge and normalcy.

- **Genealogy and Archaeology**: Two complementary methods for analyzing history. Archaeology examines the underlying rules that govern discourse in different eras (epistemes), while genealogy traces how power relations shape knowledge and institutions over time.

- **Biopower and Biopolitics**: Modern states exercise power not through overt violence but through regulation of populations - managing birth rates, health, sexuality, and life itself. This represents a shift from sovereign power (the power to kill) to biopower (the power to make live).

- **Disciplinary Society**: Modern institutions (prisons, schools, hospitals, factories) create "docile bodies" through surveillance, normalization, and examination. The Panopticon serves as the architectural metaphor for this pervasive disciplinary power.

- **The Care of the Self**: In his later work, Foucault explored ancient practices of self-cultivation and ethical self-formation as potential resources for contemporary freedom and resistance to normalization.

## Key Works

|------|------|------------------|
| *Madness and Civilization* | 1961 | Traces how "madness" was constructed as a category of exclusion in the classical age |
| *The Order of Things* | 1966 | Analyzes the underlying epistemes that structure knowledge in different historical periods |
| *Discipline and Punish* | 1975 | Examines the birth of the prison and modern disciplinary power, introducing panopticism |
| *The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1* | 1976 | Critiques the "repressive hypothesis" and introduces the concept of biopower |
| *The Archaeology of Knowledge* | 1969 | Methodological elaboration of archaeological analysis of discourse |

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "Where there is power, there is resistance." - *The History of Sexuality*

> "People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don't know is what what they do does." - *Madness and Civilization*

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Friedrich Nietzsche**: Foucault's genealogical method derives from Nietzsche's critique of morality and his perspectivism. Both reject universal truths in favor of historical contingency.

- **Louis Althusser**: His teacher at ENS; Foucault inherited Althusser's concern with ideology and the structures that shape subjectivity, though he departed significantly in method.

- **Georges Canguilhem**: His doctoral advisor; influenced Foucault's approach to the history of science and medicine, particularly the distinction between normal and pathological.

- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: Complex relationship of influence and opposition; Foucault rejected Sartrean existentialism's emphasis on the autonomous subject while sharing concerns about freedom.
