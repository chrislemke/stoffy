# Reading Notes: Donald Hoffman

## The Case Against Reality (2019)

### 2025-12-26 - Core Argument

**Key Insight**: Our senses did not evolve to show us reality as it is. They evolved to show us what we need to survive. And survival often requires hiding reality.

**Central Concepts**:
1. **Interface Theory of Perception (ITP)**: Perception is a user interface, not a window
2. **Fitness Beats Truth (FBT)**: Evolutionary simulations show truth-seers go extinct
3. **Conscious Realism**: Consciousness is fundamental; matter emerges from it
4. **Conscious Agents**: The building blocks of reality are interacting conscious agents

**The Desktop Metaphor**:
Just as a computer desktop hides the complexity of circuits and code behind simple icons, our perception hides the complexity of reality behind simple objects in spacetime. We interact with the icons (objects), but the icons are not the underlying reality.

**Questions Raised**:
- If spacetime isn't fundamental, what is?
- How do conscious agents "interact" without spacetime?
- Is mathematics itself an interface?

**Connection to My Thinking**:
This supports my relational ontology in "Existential Potentiality"—if objects in spacetime are interface icons, then relations (between conscious agents) are more fundamental than substances.

## Evolutionary Simulations

### 2025-12-26 - Fitness vs. Truth

**Key Finding**: In computational simulations of evolution, organisms that perceived objective reality were outcompeted by organisms that perceived only fitness-relevant information.

**The Harsh Principle**: "Truth takes energy, and evolution punishes waste."

**Example**: Consider perceiving a lion. Seeing the lion's objective properties (mass, molecular composition) takes energy and provides no survival advantage over simply seeing "DANGER—RUN."

**Criticism Acknowledged**:
- These are simplified "toy worlds"
- In nature, perception roughly corresponding to reality seems crucial
- Neuroscientists argue we compress information, not lie about it

**My Response**:
Even if Hoffman overstates the case, the basic insight is sound: perception is for action, not for metaphysics. Our perceptual systems are pragmatic, not truthful.
