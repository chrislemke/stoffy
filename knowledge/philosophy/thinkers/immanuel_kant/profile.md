## Biography

### Early Life and Family
Immanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724, in Königsberg, East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), into an artisan family of modest means. His father, Johann Georg Kant, was a master harness maker, and his mother, Anna Regina Reuter, was the educated daughter of a harness maker. He was the fourth of nine children, six of whom survived to adulthood. The family were devout Pietists – Lutheran revivalists who emphasized personal piety, simplicity of worship, and individual access to God. Kant was baptized "Emanuel" but later changed the spelling to "Immanuel" after learning Hebrew.

### Education
At age eight, Kant entered the Collegium Fridericianum, a Pietist Latin school where he acquired his lifelong love for Latin classics, especially the naturalistic poet Lucretius. He studied there for eight and a half years. In 1740, at age sixteen, he enrolled at the University of Königsberg, where he studied the philosophy of Leibniz and Wolff under Martin Knutzen, a rationalist who introduced Kant to Newton's mathematical physics and British empiricism.

### Career and the "Silent Decade"
His father's death in 1746 interrupted his studies, forcing Kant to work as a private tutor in the towns surrounding Königsberg until 1754. He returned to the University as a Privatdozent (unsalaried lecturer paid directly by students) and remained in this precarious position for fifteen years. In 1770, he finally secured a professorship of logic and metaphysics at age forty-six. There followed the "silent decade" (1770-1781) during which Kant published almost nothing while developing the revolutionary ideas that would become the *Critique of Pure Reason*.

### The "Königsberg Clock"
Kant's legendary daily routine made him a local institution. He rose at 5:00 AM, worked until noon, took lunch (his only real meal), then walked – always at the same time, always the same route. Locals reportedly set their clocks by his appearances. He taught on the same days, dined with friends according to strict schedule, and retired to bed at exactly 10:00 PM. This rigorous routine allowed him to produce one of the most comprehensive philosophical systems in history despite a frail constitution.

### Personal Characteristics
Of medium height with bright blue eyes (he was blind in one eye late in life), Kant had a delicate constitution but maintained his health through strict regimen. He never married, never traveled more than fifty miles from Königsberg, yet was renowned as a lively dinner guest and engaging conversationalist. A single portrait hung in his study – that of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whom he deeply admired. David Hume was the philosopher who, Kant said, "awoke him from his dogmatic slumber."

### Death
Kant's health declined in his final years. He died on February 12, 1804, at age seventy-nine. His final words were reportedly "Es ist gut" ("It is good"). Though he had hoped for a small, private funeral, thousands attended to pay respects to the Sage of Königsberg.

## Core Ideas

- **Transcendental Idealism**: Space and time are not features of things-in-themselves but are forms of human intuition that structure all experience. We can only know phenomena (things as they appear to us), not noumena (things-in-themselves). This mediates between rationalism and empiricism.

- **The Copernican Revolution in Philosophy**: Rather than asking how our knowledge conforms to objects, Kant asked how objects conform to our faculties of knowledge. The mind actively structures experience through its a priori forms of intuition and categories of understanding.

- **Synthetic A Priori Knowledge**: Some knowledge is both informative about the world (synthetic) and knowable independently of experience (a priori). Mathematics and fundamental principles of natural science are examples. This solves Hume's problem of justifying causation.

- **The Categorical Imperative**: The supreme principle of morality commands unconditionally. Key formulations: act only according to maxims you could will as universal law; treat humanity always as an end, never merely as a means; act as a legislating member of the kingdom of ends.

- **Autonomy and Moral Freedom**: Rational beings are autonomous, giving themselves the moral law through reason. This rational self-legislation is the basis of human dignity. Though we are determined in the phenomenal world, we are free in the noumenal realm.

- **The Antinomies of Pure Reason**: When reason ventures beyond experience into metaphysics, it generates contradictions (antinomies). Both thesis and antithesis can be "proven" regarding the finitude of the world, free will, God's existence. This reveals the limits of pure reason.

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| *Critique of Pure Reason* | 1781/1787 | His masterwork on epistemology and metaphysics; establishes transcendental idealism and limits of knowledge |
| *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* | 1785 | Foundational work on ethics; introduces the categorical imperative and moral autonomy |
| *Critique of Practical Reason* | 1788 | Systematic treatment of moral philosophy; examines the postulates of practical reason |
| *Critique of Judgment* | 1790 | Third critique addressing aesthetics and teleology; bridges theoretical and practical philosophy |
| *Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics* | 1783 | Accessible summary of the first Critique's main arguments |

## Relevance to My Thinking

Kant's synthesis of rationalism and empiricism established the framework for much subsequent philosophy. His emphasis on the active role of the mind in constituting experience resonates with cognitive science. The categorical imperative remains a powerful tool for moral reasoning, though its formalism raises questions.

## Key Quotes

> "Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and more steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me." — *Critique of Practical Reason* (1788), Conclusion

> "Sapere aude! Have courage to use your own understanding!" — *An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?* (1784)

> "Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind." — *Critique of Pure Reason* A51/B75

> "But though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all arises out of experience." — *Critique of Pure Reason*, Introduction

> "I had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith." — *Critique of Pure Reason*, Preface to Second Edition (Bxxx)

> "All the interests of my reason, speculative as well as practical, combine in the three following questions: 1. What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope?" — *Critique of Pure Reason* A805/B833

> "Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." — *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* (1785)

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[thinkers/david_hume/profile|David Hume]]**: Kant famously said Hume "awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers." The first Critique is largely a response to Humean skepticism about causation, salvaging knowledge through the doctrine of synthetic a priori.

- **[[thinkers/georg_hegel/profile|G.W.F. Hegel]]**: Developed German idealism beyond Kant, criticizing the thing-in-itself as incoherent and seeking to overcome Kantian dualisms through dialectical reason.

- **[[thinkers/john_rawls/profile|John Rawls]]**: His theory of justice as fairness draws heavily on Kantian ethics, particularly autonomy, dignity, and treating persons as ends in themselves.

- **[[thinkers/rene_descartes/profile|René Descartes]]**: Kant shared Descartes' concern with foundations of knowledge but replaced the Cartesian cogito with the transcendental unity of apperception.

- **[[thinkers/arthur_schopenhauer/profile|Arthur Schopenhauer]]**: Claimed to be Kant's true heir while identifying the thing-in-itself with blind Will. Deeply influenced by Kant's epistemology but rejected his ethics.

- **[[thinkers/karl_friston/profile|Karl Friston]]**: Predictive processing and the Free Energy Principle can be seen as a computational Kantianism – the brain actively constructs experience through predictive models.

- **[[thinkers/jakob_hohwy/profile|Jakob Hohwy]]**: Explicitly develops the Kantian roots of predictive processing theory.

- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**: The only portrait in Kant's study; profoundly influenced Kant's moral philosophy and his view of human dignity.

## My Notes

### 2025-12-25 - Initial Profile
Kant lived his entire life in Königsberg, never traveling more than 50 miles from his birthplace, yet produced one of the most comprehensive philosophical systems ever constructed. His critical philosophy marks a decisive turning point in the history of philosophy, and nearly all subsequent philosophy defines itself in relation to Kant.
