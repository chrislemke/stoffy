# Thinker Profile: Thomas Aquinas

**Type**: philosopher, theologian
**Era**: medieval (1225-1274 CE)
**Traditions**: Thomism, Scholasticism, Aristotelianism

## Core Ideas

- **Five Ways**: Five proofs for the existence of God (motion, causation, contingency, gradation, teleology)
- **Natural Law**: Moral law is accessible through reason; human law should reflect eternal and natural law
- **Faith and Reason**: Faith and reason are compatible and complementary; philosophy serves as "handmaiden" to theology
- **Analogia Entis**: God and creatures share being analogically, not univocally or equivocally
