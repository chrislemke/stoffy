# Thinker Profile: Ludwig Wittgenstein

**Type**: Philosopher
**Era**: Contemporary (1889-1951)
**Traditions**: Analytic Philosophy, Logical Atomism (early), Ordinary Language Philosophy (later)

## Core Ideas

- **Picture Theory of Language (Early)**: In the Tractatus, language mirrors reality through logical form. Propositions are pictures of possible states of affairs, and what can be said at all can be said clearly.

- **Language Games (Later)**: Meaning is not fixed correspondence but arises from use within various "language games" - rule-governed activities embedded in forms of life. Words acquire meaning through their function in practice.

- **Family Resemblance**: Concepts are not defined by essential features shared by all instances but by overlapping similarities, like family members who share different traits without any single common feature.

- **Private Language Argument**: A purely private language - one whose words refer only to the speaker's private sensations - is impossible. Meaning requires public criteria and shared practices.

- **Showing vs. Saying**: The most important truths (ethics, aesthetics, the mystical) cannot be stated in propositions but can only be shown. The limits of language are the limits of the world.

- **Therapeutic Philosophy**: Philosophy's proper task is not to construct theories but to dissolve conceptual confusions. Philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday.

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." - Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus

> "The meaning of a word is its use in the language." - Philosophical Investigations

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Bertrand Russell**: Early mentor at Cambridge who recognized Wittgenstein's genius and helped publish the Tractatus, though their philosophical paths diverged significantly.

- **Gottlob Frege**: Foundational influence on Wittgenstein's early work on logic and the philosophy of language.

- **G.E.M. Anscombe**: His student, executor, and translator who became a major philosopher in her own right, continuing and developing his insights.

- **Soren Kierkegaard**: Wittgenstein deeply admired Kierkegaard's existential and religious writings, seeing a kindred spirit in his struggle with the limits of language.
