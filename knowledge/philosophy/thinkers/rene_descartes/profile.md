# Thinker Profile: Rene Descartes

**Type**: Philosopher
**Era**: Modern (1596-1650)
**Traditions**: Rationalism, Foundationalism, Cartesian Dualism, Mechanism

## Core Ideas

- **Cogito Ergo Sum ("I think, therefore I am")**: The foundational certainty that survives radical doubt. Even if an evil demon deceives us about everything, the very act of doubting proves we exist as thinking things.

- **Methodological Doubt**: A systematic process of doubting all beliefs that can possibly be doubted, to find what remains absolutely certain. This includes doubting the senses, mathematical truths, and even the external world.

- **Mind-Body Dualism**: Reality consists of two fundamentally different substances: res cogitans (thinking substance/mind) and res extensa (extended substance/matter). The mind is non-physical and indivisible; the body is physical and divisible.

- **Clear and Distinct Ideas**: The criterion for truth. What we perceive clearly (fully present to the mind) and distinctly (sharply separated from other ideas) must be true. God guarantees this connection between clarity and truth.

- **Innate Ideas**: Some ideas are not derived from experience but are innate to the mind, including the ideas of God, mathematical truths, and the self. These provide the foundation for certain knowledge.

- **Mechanical Philosophy**: The physical world operates like a machine, governed by mathematical laws. All natural phenomena can be explained through matter and motion, without appeal to Aristotelian forms or purposes.

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| *Discourse on the Method* | 1637 | Introduces his philosophical method and famous cogito; accessible introduction to his system |
| *Meditations on First Philosophy* | 1641 | Systematic application of methodological doubt; arguments for God's existence and mind-body distinction |
| *Principles of Philosophy* | 1644 | Comprehensive presentation of his metaphysics and physics in textbook form |
| *Rules for the Direction of the Mind* | 1628 | Early work outlining rules for methodical inquiry and achieving certain knowledge |
| *Passions of the Soul* | 1649 | Analysis of emotions and their relation to mind-body interaction |

## Relevance to My Thinking

Descartes' method of radical doubt offers a powerful tool for examining assumptions. His insistence on finding secure foundations for knowledge speaks to the epistemological anxiety of modernity. The mind-body problem he articulated remains central to consciousness studies today.

## Key Quotes

> "I think, therefore I am." - *Discourse on the Method* (1637)

> "It is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to use it well." - *Discourse on the Method* (1637)

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Baruch Spinoza**: Responded to Cartesian dualism with monism, arguing that mind and body are aspects of one substance (God/Nature). Spinoza's rationalist method was influenced by Descartes.

- **John Locke**: Rejected Descartes' innate ideas, arguing instead that the mind begins as a blank slate (tabula rasa) and all knowledge derives from experience.

- **Immanuel Kant**: Sought to reconcile Cartesian rationalism with empiricism. Kant credited Descartes with establishing the importance of the subject in epistemology.

- **Gilbert Ryle**: Criticized Cartesian dualism as the "ghost in the machine" error, arguing that mental concepts refer to behavioral dispositions rather than inner substances.

## My Notes

### 2025-12-25 - Initial Profile

Descartes marks the decisive break with medieval scholasticism and the beginning of modern philosophy. His radical skepticism and turn to subjectivity as the foundation of knowledge set the agenda for centuries of philosophical inquiry.
