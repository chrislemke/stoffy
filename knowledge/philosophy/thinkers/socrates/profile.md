# Thinker Profile: Socrates

**Type**: Philosopher
**Era**: Ancient (c. 470-399 BCE)
**Traditions**: Socratic Method, Classical Greek Philosophy, Virtue Ethics, Moral Philosophy
**Epithet**: "Father of Western Philosophy"

## Biography

### Early Life and Background
Socrates was born c. 470 BCE in the Athenian deme of Alopece to Sophroniscus, a stoneworker (or sculptor), and Phaenarete, a midwife. As an Athenian citizen of relatively affluent background, he inherited part of his father's estate, securing a life reasonably free of financial concerns. His education followed Athenian custom: reading, writing, gymnastics, poetry, and music.

### Personal Life
Socrates married Xanthippe when he was in his fifties, with whom he had three sons. Some sources suggest a second marriage to a daughter of Aristides, an Athenian statesman. Xanthippe became legendary for her supposed shrewishness, though this may be later embellishment.

### Military Service
During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE), Socrates served as a hoplite (heavy infantry soldier) with shield, long spear, and face mask. He participated in three military campaigns:
- **Potidaea (432 BCE)**: Saved the life of Alcibiades, the popular general
- **Delium (424 BCE)**: Noted for his courage and composure during the retreat
- **Amphipolis (422 BCE)**: Another notable engagement

### The Socratic Problem
Since Socrates wrote nothing himself, all our knowledge comes from three main sources:
1. **Plato's Dialogues**: Philosophical portrait, possibly idealized
2. **Xenophon's Works**: Pragmatic and pious depiction
3. **Aristophanes' Comedies**: Satirical portrayal as a sophistic intellectual

Scholars debate which source best represents the historical Socrates.

## Core Ideas

- **The Socratic Method (Elenchus)**: A form of cooperative argumentative dialogue using questions and answers to stimulate critical thinking. The Greek word "elenchus" means "putting to the test" or "refutation." The method involves: (1) interlocutor states a thesis, (2) Socrates questions to elicit further premises, (3) Socrates shows these premises contradict the original thesis, (4) the thesis is refuted, leading to *aporia* (puzzlement).

- **Socratic Ignorance**: "I know that I know nothing" – the paradox emphasizing intellectual humility as the foundation of wisdom. Unlike the Sophists, Socrates believed knowledge was possible, but the first step was recognizing one's ignorance.

- **The Unexamined Life**: "The unexamined life is not worth living" (Apology 38a) – self-reflection and questioning are essential to meaningful human existence.

- **Virtue is Knowledge**: Wrongdoing stems from ignorance; knowing the good necessarily leads to doing the good. No one errs willingly (*akrasia* is impossible).

- **Care of the Soul (Psyche)**: Philosophy's primary purpose is the care and improvement of the soul through the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, not wealth or reputation.

- **Maieutics (Intellectual Midwifery)**: In *Theaetetus*, Socrates describes his method as "midwifery" – helping others give birth to their own ideas, just as his mother helped women give birth.

- **The Daimonion**: Socrates claimed to be guided by a divine voice or sign (daimonion) that would warn him against certain actions, but never commanded him positively.

- **Unity of the Virtues**: All virtues (courage, justice, piety, temperance, wisdom) are ultimately one, or at least inseparable from each other.

## Key Works

All works are preserved through the writings of his students, primarily Plato and Xenophon.

| Work | Author | Year (composition) | Key Contribution |
|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| *Apology* | Plato | c. 399 BCE | Defense speech at trial; articulates philosophy as divine mission; most authentic record |
| *Crito* | Plato | c. 399 BCE | Obligations to the state; why Socrates refused escape; justice over self-preservation |
| *Euthyphro* | Plato | c. 399 BCE | Definition of piety; the Euthyphro dilemma about divine command |
| *Phaedo* | Plato | c. 360 BCE | Arguments for immortality of the soul; death as liberation; final hours |
| *Symposium* | Plato | c. 385 BCE | Exploration of love (eros) and the ascent to Beauty itself; speech of Diotima |
| *Meno* | Plato | c. 385 BCE | Recollection theory; can virtue be taught?; slave boy demonstration |
| *Theaetetus* | Plato | c. 369 BCE | Nature of knowledge; maieutic method explained; Socrates as midwife |
| *Republic* (Book I) | Plato | c. 375 BCE | "What is justice?" – classic elenctic dialogue |
| *Memorabilia* | Xenophon | c. 371 BCE | Defense and recollections; practical Socrates; daily conversations |
| *Symposium* | Xenophon | c. 360 BCE | Alternative account of Socratic teaching on love |

### The Trial and Death

In 399 BCE, Socrates was tried before a jury of 501 Athenian citizens on charges of:
1. **Asebeia (Impiety)**: "Failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges" and "introducing new deities"
2. **Corrupting the Youth**: Allegedly teaching young men to question traditional values

He was convicted by a vote of 280 to 221. When asked to propose an alternative penalty, Socrates sardonically suggested free meals at the Prytaneum (an honor for Olympic victors). The jury then sentenced him to death. He refused offers of escape, arguing he must abide by Athenian law even when unjust.

He died drinking hemlock poison, surrounded by friends and students.

## Relevance to My Thinking

The Socratic method remains the foundation of philosophical inquiry – the practice of questioning assumptions, exposing contradictions, and pursuing truth through dialogue. His insistence that wisdom begins with recognizing one's ignorance resonates with both ancient skepticism and contemporary epistemic humility. The figure of Socrates as gadfly – annoying the complacent city into thought – embodies philosophy as an activity rather than a doctrine.

> "The unexamined life is not worth living." — *Apology* 38a

> "Not life, but a good life, is to be chiefly valued." — *Crito* 48b

> "It is never right to do wrong or to requite wrong with wrong, or when we suffer evil to defend ourselves by doing evil in return." — *Crito* 49d

> "I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas when I do not know, neither do I think I know." — *Apology* 21d

> "My dear Crito, why should we care so much about what the majority think?" — *Crito* 44c

> "Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius; please pay it and don't forget it." — *Phaedo* 118a (his last words)

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[thinkers/plato/profile|Plato]]**: Primary student who preserved and developed Socratic philosophy through dialogues; founded the Academy; idealized Socrates as the philosopher par excellence

- **[[thinkers/aristotle/profile|Aristotle]]**: Intellectual grandchild; studied under Plato at the Academy; developed systematic philosophy that departed from Socratic questioning toward categorical science

- **[[thinkers/soren_kierkegaard/profile|Søren Kierkegaard]]**: Wrote dissertation on Socratic irony (*The Concept of Irony*); saw Socrates as model for indirect communication and existential inquiry

- **[[thinkers/friedrich_nietzsche/profile|Friedrich Nietzsche]]**: Viewed Socrates ambivalently – as the destroyer of tragic culture and the "theoretical man" who privileged reason over life

- **[[thinkers/socrates/profile|The Stoics]]**: Adopted Socratic ethics, especially the unity of virtue and the idea that virtue is sufficient for happiness

- **[[thinkers/david_hume/profile|The Skeptics]]**: The Pyrrhonists traced their lineage to Socratic doubt and *aporia*

- **Alcibiades**: Student and lover; brilliant but morally questionable; his later treachery contributed to suspicion of Socrates

- **Xenophon**: Student who provided alternative portrait; more practical, less philosophical than Plato's Socrates
