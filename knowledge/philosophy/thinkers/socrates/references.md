## Notes

### 2025-12-31 - Initial References Update
Added potential cross-references to existing thoughts in repository. Socratic method and ethical themes connect to multiple exploration areas.

**Future Integration Opportunities**:
- Create explicit "Socratic Method" thought connecting elenchus to computational dialectics
- Link Socratic "care of the soul" to consciousness explorations
- Explore Socratic ignorance in relation to epistemic humility themes
