# Personal Reflections on Mark Solms

## What Draws Me to This Thinker

Solms takes the "hard problem" seriously while offering a functional solution. Most functionalists seem to dismiss subjective experience as an epiphenomenon or explain it away. Solms does neither—he locates the "feel" of consciousness in a concrete mechanism (free energy dynamics in brainstem) without reducing away its phenomenal character.

The brainstem thesis is also refreshingly radical. While everyone studies cortical correlates of consciousness, Solms points downward to the evolutionary ancient structures that even simple organisms possess. This has profound implications: consciousness might be far more widespread than cortical chauvinism would suggest.

## How This Thinker Challenges My Views

### The Cortex as Secondary
I've been assuming that sophisticated cognition (language, reasoning, self-reflection) is central to consciousness. Solms inverts this: the cortex provides content and complexity, but consciousness itself—the raw "feel" of being—arises from the brainstem's affective core. This is humbling and probably correct.

### Affect Before Perception
Standard models treat perception as primary and affect as a response to perceived content. Solms reverses this: affect is primary, and perceptions become conscious only when connected to affective significance. We don't first see the tiger, then feel fear—fear makes the tiger visible.

### Psychoanalysis as Legitimate
I've been skeptical of psychoanalysis as scientifically outdated. Solms's neuropsychoanalytic project shows Freud's insights can be grounded in neuroscience. The id as brainstem, pleasure principle as free energy minimization—these aren't just metaphors but functional mappings.

## What I Disagree With

### Dual-Aspect Monism as Solution
Solms claims consciousness IS the subjective aspect of homeostatic regulation. But does naming both aspects of the same process actually explain why there's a subjective aspect at all? The explanatory gap between function and feel may just be relocated, not bridged.

### Cortex as Mere Content
While brainstem may be necessary for consciousness, is it sufficient? The rich texture of human experience—colors, concepts, narratives—seems to require cortical processes. Maybe consciousness is distributed: brainstem provides the "feel," cortex provides the "content," and neither alone constitutes full experience.

### Artificial Consciousness
Solms says we'll know we've solved consciousness when we can build an artificial one. But if affect requires biological homeostasis, can silicon ever genuinely "feel"? His position seems to imply no—but he's also working on artificial consciousness projects. Tension here.

## Synthesis Possibilities

### With Anil Seth
Seth emphasizes interoceptive inference and "beast machine" embodiment. Solms locates consciousness in brainstem homeostasis. These seem deeply compatible—perhaps Seth provides the predictive processing framework, Solms provides the anatomical grounding.

### With Friston
The Solms-Friston collaboration is already explicit. Interesting that Friston's mathematical formalism needed Solms's clinical intuitions to locate consciousness in affect. The FEP is a universal principle; Solms shows where it becomes conscious.

### With Metzinger
Metzinger's PSM (phenomenal self-model) is cortical and cognitive. Solms's brainstem thesis suggests there's a more fundamental "affective self" beneath the cortical self-model. The felt sense of being an organism precedes the represented self.

### With Eastern Philosophy
The brainstem as source of consciousness has interesting parallels with Buddhist emphasis on "mindfulness of body" and the Taoist "return to the source." Perhaps advanced meditators access brainstem consciousness by quieting cortical elaboration?

## Personal Impact

Solms makes me reconsider the relationship between thinking and feeling. Philosophy often treats emotion as obstacle to clear thought. But if affect is the foundation of consciousness, then feeling is not opposed to knowing—it IS knowing, at the most basic level. The Cartesian "I think, therefore I am" becomes "I feel, therefore I am."

## Evolving Thoughts

### 2025-12-26
Initial engagement through web research and key papers. The brainstem thesis is the crucial insight. Need to read "The Hidden Spring" in full to assess the clinical evidence. The Solms-Friston collaboration on affect-as-free-energy is a major synthesis worth developing.
