# Mark Solms

## Overview

Mark Solms is a South African neuropsychologist and psychoanalyst who pioneered the field of **neuropsychoanalysis**—the integration of Freudian psychoanalytic theory with contemporary neuroscience. His groundbreaking work locates the source of consciousness not in the cerebral cortex but in the brainstem, arguing that consciousness is fundamentally **affective** (felt) rather than cognitive. Through collaboration with Karl Friston, Solms has formalized this insight using the Free Energy Principle.

## Core Ideas

### 1. Brainstem as the Source of Consciousness
Solms argues that consciousness arises in the upper brainstem (reticular activating system and periaqueductal grey), not the cortex. Patients can lose their entire cortex and remain conscious, but damage to the brainstem abolishes consciousness entirely. The cortex is for *content* of consciousness; the brainstem is its *source*.

### 2. Affective Consciousness as Primary
The most basic form of consciousness is not perception or cognition but **affect**—raw feeling. Consciousness is primarily interoceptive: it registers internal bodily states, not external reality. External perceptions become conscious only when connected to these deeper affective systems.

### 3. Consciousness and Homeostasis
Consciousness serves homeostatic self-regulation. We become conscious of states that require active management—unpredicted deviations from expected conditions. Consciousness is awareness of the "slippage" between predictions and reality.

### 4. Free Energy and Affect
In collaboration with Friston, Solms formalized affect in terms of free energy:
- **Pleasure** = decrease in expected uncertainty (prediction error resolved)
- **Unpleasure** = increase in expected uncertainty (prediction error unresolved)
- Consciousness is the subjective "feel" of free energy dynamics

### 5. Neuropsychoanalysis
Solms sees himself as completing Freud's abandoned "Project for a Scientific Psychology." Freudian concepts (id, ego, drives) can be grounded in neuroscience. The id is the source of all consciousness—the brainstem's affective core.

## Intellectual Context

### Influences
- **Sigmund Freud**: Psychoanalytic theory of drives, unconscious, and affect
- **Jaak Panksepp**: Affective neuroscience, primary emotional systems
- **Karl Friston**: Free Energy Principle as formalization of consciousness
- **Antonio Damasio**: Somatic marker hypothesis, embodied emotion

### Influenced
- Neuropsychoanalytic movement
- Affective consciousness research
- Free Energy approaches to consciousness

### Tensions With
- **Cortical theories of consciousness** (Global Workspace, IIT): Solms locates consciousness in brainstem, not cortex
- **Cognitive approaches**: Consciousness is affective before cognitive
- **Eliminative materialism**: Solms takes subjective experience seriously as explanatory target

## Key Contributions

| Contribution | Significance |
|--------------|--------------|
| Neuropsychoanalysis | Bridged psychoanalysis and neuroscience |
| Brainstem consciousness thesis | Relocated source of consciousness from cortex |
| Affective primacy | Identified feeling as the foundation of awareness |
| Friston-Solms collaboration | Formalized consciousness in FEP terms |
| Dual-aspect monism | Consciousness and homeostasis are two aspects of one process |

## Why This Thinker Matters

Solms provides a compelling answer to the "hard problem" of consciousness by identifying its function (homeostatic self-regulation) and mechanism (free energy minimization) in the same neural substrate (brainstem). This is radical: most consciousness research focuses on cortical processes, but Solms shows the cortex may be downstream of more fundamental affective processes. For my synthesis work, Solms connects:
- **Free Energy Principle** with **phenomenology of feeling**
- **Freudian id** with **predictive processing**
- **Embodiment** with **consciousness** in a concrete, testable way
