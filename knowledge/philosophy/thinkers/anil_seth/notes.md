# Notes on Anil Seth

## Key Concepts to Remember

### Controlled Hallucination
- Perception = brain's best guess about causes of sensory signals
- "Hallucination" because it's generated internally
- "Controlled" because constrained by sensory reality
- Reality = hallucination we agree on

### The Beast Machine
- We are not cognitive computers
- Consciousness grounded in biological self-regulation
- Being alive is the foundation of being conscious
- Interoception (sensing body) is as fundamental as exteroception (sensing world)

### Interoceptive Inference
- Brain predicts internal bodily states
- Emotions = predictions about physiological state
- Updates James-Lange theory with predictive processing
- Selfhood emerges from visceral self-prediction

### The Self as Prediction
- No homunculus, no inner observer
- Self is a useful model brain constructs
- Continuous construction, not discovery
- Multiple layers: bodily self, perspectival self, volitional self, narrative self

## Key Distinctions

### Hard Problem vs. Real Problem
- Hard problem: Why is there experience at all? (Chalmers)
- Real problem: Why does a particular experience have the properties it does?
- Seth focuses on real problem as scientifically tractable

### Levels vs. Contents
- Levels: Wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, coma
- Contents: What is experienced (red, pain, self)
- Need theory of both to explain consciousness

## Connections to My Thoughts

- **Improvised Self**: Seth's self-as-prediction + Chater's flat mind = shallow, continuous self-construction
- **Wu Wei and Free Energy**: Minimal interoceptive prediction error = flow, effortlessness
- **Existential Potentiality**: Markov blankets + beast machine = nodes defined by self-regulatory boundaries
- **Kompatibilismus 2.0**: Agency as precision-weighted prediction about volitional outcomes

## Quotes Collection

> "We're all hallucinating all the time; when we agree about our hallucinations, we call it 'reality.'"

> "The self is a prediction."

> "We're not cognitive computers, we're beast machines."

> "Consciousness is not about information processing—it's about biological regulation."
