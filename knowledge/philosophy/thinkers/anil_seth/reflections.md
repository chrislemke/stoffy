# Personal Reflections on Anil Seth

## What Draws Me to This Thinker

Seth brings predictive processing down to earth—literally into the body. While Friston provides mathematics and Hohwy provides philosophy, Seth provides phenomenology grounded in biology. The "beast machine" concept captures something profound: consciousness isn't about abstract information processing, it's about the felt experience of being alive in a body that must regulate itself.

## How This Thinker Challenges My Views

### The Priority of Interoception
I've been focused on exteroceptive prediction (perceiving the world), but Seth argues interoception is equally fundamental. The self doesn't just model the world—it primarily models its own body. This is humbling and probably correct.

### Deflating the Hard Problem
Seth's move from the "hard problem" to the "real problem" is pragmatic and probably necessary for progress. But I'm not fully convinced we can dissolve Chalmers's question by reframing it. The explanatory gap between neural processes and felt experience persists.

## What I Disagree With

### Is "Controlled Hallucination" the Right Metaphor?
The term is provocative and memorable, but "hallucination" implies error or pathology. Normal perception is also prediction-based, so calling it "hallucination" may confuse more than clarify. Maybe "controlled construction" or "embodied inference" would be more accurate.

### Beast Machine vs. Computational Mind
Seth draws a sharp line between "beast machines" and "cognitive computers." But aren't we both? The hierarchical generative models ARE computational. The embodiment doesn't negate the computation—it grounds and constrains it.

## Synthesis Possibilities

### With Metzinger's PSM Theory
Seth's interoceptive inference + Metzinger's phenomenal self-model = the self is a transparent, embodied prediction. We don't experience the prediction AS a prediction; it presents as immediate reality.

### With Friston's Free Energy
Consciousness as the felt quality of free energy minimization in self-modeling systems. Low prediction error = clarity; high prediction error = confusion, anxiety, maybe even psychedelic states.

### With Eastern Philosophy
The "self as prediction" resonates with Buddhist no-self (anatta). The self is not found because it's not a thing—it's a process, a pattern of prediction. Meditation might be learning to observe the predictions without being fully captured by them.

## Personal Impact

Seth's work makes me take embodiment seriously. Philosophy of mind often treats the body as incidental—a vessel for the brain. Seth insists the body is the foundation. This has implications for how I think about AI consciousness: can something without a body to regulate truly be conscious?

## Evolving Thoughts

### 2025-12-26
Initial engagement via website and reviews. The "beast machine" concept is the key insight. Consciousness isn't computation plus something mysterious—it's biological self-regulation that feels like something from the inside.
