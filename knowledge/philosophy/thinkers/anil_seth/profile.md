# Thinker Profile: Anil Seth

**Type**: Neuroscientist and Consciousness Researcher
**Era**: Contemporary (b. 1972)
**Institutions**: University of Sussex (Professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience), Director of Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research
**Traditions**: Cognitive Neuroscience, Predictive Processing, Consciousness Science

## Core Ideas

### 1. Controlled Hallucination
Perception is not a direct window onto an objective reality but a form of "controlled hallucination" generated by the brain. The brain constantly generates hypotheses about the causes of sensory signals, and what we experience as reality is the brain's best prediction, constrained by sensory input. Reality is a hallucination that happens to agree with the world.

### 2. Interoceptive Inference
The sense of self arises from the brain's predictions about internal bodily states (interoception). Emotions are not reactions to the world but the brain's predictions about physiological states—a predictive processing update of the James-Lange theory. Consciousness is fundamentally embodied and tied to the biological imperative of staying alive.

### 3. The Beast Machine
We are not "cognitive computers" but "beast machines"—organisms whose consciousness is fundamentally shaped by being alive in a body that must regulate itself. The fundamental drive to stay alive is not separate from conscious experience but its foundation. Selfhood emerges from visceral self-prediction.

### 4. Levels and Contents of Consciousness
Consciousness has levels (wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia) and contents (what is experienced). Understanding consciousness requires addressing both dimensions. The "real problem" of consciousness is explaining why a particular experience has the properties it does, rather than the "hard problem" of why there is experience at all.

### 5. Perception as Inference
Building on Friston's predictive processing, perception is hierarchical Bayesian inference. Top-down predictions cascade down neural hierarchies, meeting bottom-up prediction errors. Attention modulates precision (confidence) of prediction errors. Perception is active, constructive, and creative.

### 6. The Self as Prediction
The experience of being a "self" is itself a prediction—a model that the brain constructs to regulate the body. There is no homunculus, no inner observer—just patterns of prediction about embodied existence. The self is a useful fiction the brain generates.

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|

| "Interoceptive inference, emotion, and the embodied self" | 2013 | With Critchley; extends predictive processing to emotion |

## Relevance to My Thinking

Seth's work provides crucial bridges in my philosophical synthesis:

1. **Embodied Consciousness**: His "beast machine" thesis reinforces that consciousness is not computational abstraction but biological self-regulation. This connects to my Spinozan-Fristonian synthesis.

2. **Improvised Self Connection**: Seth's "self as prediction" maps onto Chater's improvisation—we don't discover a pre-existing self; we construct one moment by moment through visceral prediction.

3. **Hard Problem Deflation**: His focus on the "real problem" over the "hard problem" aligns with my functionalist leanings. Explain the properties of experience, not just that it exists.

4. **Interoception and Wu Wei**: Low prediction error in bodily states might be the computational correlate of flow states and Taoist effortlessness.

## Key Quotes

> "We're all hallucinating all the time; when we agree about our hallucinations, we call it 'reality.'"

> "The self is a prediction."

> "We're not cognitive computers, we're beast machines."

> "Consciousness is not about information processing—it's about biological regulation of our living bodies."

## My Notes

### 2025-12-26 - Initial Profile Creation
Created as part of FEP research project. Seth is essential for understanding how predictive processing applies to consciousness and embodiment. His "beast machine" concept is particularly important for grounding consciousness in biological self-regulation rather than abstract computation.
