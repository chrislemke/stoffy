# Thinker Profile: John Locke

**Type**: Philosopher
**Era**: Modern (1632-1704)
**Traditions**: Empiricism, Classical Liberalism, Social Contract Theory, Natural Law

## Core Ideas

- **Tabula Rasa (Blank Slate)**: The mind at birth is a blank slate with no innate ideas. All knowledge comes from experience, either through sensation (external experience) or reflection (internal experience). This directly opposed Cartesian rationalism and its doctrine of innate ideas.

- **Primary and Secondary Qualities**: Objects have primary qualities (extension, motion, solidity, number) that exist independently of perception, and secondary qualities (color, taste, smell, sound) that exist only as ideas in the mind produced by the object's primary qualities.

- **Natural Rights**: Humans possess natural rights to life, liberty, and property that exist prior to government. These rights derive from natural law and are not granted by the state but must be protected by it.

- **Social Contract and Government by Consent**: Legitimate government arises from the consent of the governed. People form governments to protect their natural rights, and when governments violate those rights, the people have the right to revolution.

- **Labor Theory of Property**: Property rights arise when individuals mix their labor with natural resources. By working the land or transforming raw materials, one acquires legitimate ownership, subject to the Lockean proviso that enough is left for others.

- **Personal Identity and Consciousness**: Personal identity consists in continuity of consciousness and memory, not substance. What makes me the same person over time is my ability to remember past experiences as my own.

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* | 1689 | Foundational work of empiricist epistemology; argues against innate ideas and for experience-based knowledge |
| *Two Treatises of Government* | 1689 | Argues for natural rights, government by consent, and the right to revolution; deeply influenced liberal political thought |
| *A Letter Concerning Toleration* | 1689 | Argues for religious toleration and separation of church and state |
| *Some Thoughts Concerning Education* | 1693 | Influential work on education emphasizing reason, virtue, and practical learning |

## Relevance to My Thinking

Locke's empiricism raises fundamental questions about the sources and limits of knowledge. His political philosophy laid the groundwork for modern liberal democracy and human rights discourse. The tension between his defense of natural rights and his involvement with colonialism invites critical reflection.

## Key Quotes

> "No man's knowledge here can go beyond his experience." - *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1689)

> "The end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom." - *Two Treatises of Government* (1689)

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Rene Descartes**: Locke explicitly rejected Descartes' innate ideas while sharing his interest in epistemology. The Essay is in many ways a response to Cartesian rationalism.

- **David Hume**: Extended Locke's empiricism more radically, pushing skepticism further than Locke was willing to go, particularly regarding causation and the self.

- **Thomas Jefferson**: The Declaration of Independence draws heavily on Locke's language of natural rights and the right to revolution, making Locke's ideas foundational to American political thought.

- **Immanuel Kant**: Sought to synthesize Lockean empiricism with rationalism, arguing that while knowledge begins with experience, it is not entirely derived from it.

## My Notes

### 2025-12-25 - Initial Profile

Locke's influence on both philosophy and politics is immense. His empiricism shaped epistemology for centuries, while his political philosophy helped inspire the American and French Revolutions. The Essay's account of personal identity continues to inform debates in philosophy of mind.
