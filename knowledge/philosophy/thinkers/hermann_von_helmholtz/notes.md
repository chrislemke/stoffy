## Reading Notes

### 2025-12-30 - Unconscious Inference (Secondary Sources)

**From Wikipedia and PMC articles on the topic:**

Helmholtz's core claim is that perception is not a passive reception of sensory data but an active process of inference. The brain "concludes" what must be out there based on incomplete and ambiguous sensory evidence.

**Key features of unconscious inference:**
1. **Involuntary**: We cannot stop ourselves from inferring
2. **Pre-rational**: Happens before conscious thought
3. **Reflex-like**: Automatic and fast
4. **Learned**: Through experience, especially childhood
5. **Incorrigible**: Cannot be overridden by conscious knowledge (visual illusions persist even when we know they're illusions)

**The Childhood Experience**: Helmholtz noted that retinal information is insufficient to reconstruct the world. Size, distance, and other properties must be inferred from uncertain cues. The brain learns through experience to make these inferences automatically.

**Visual Illusions**: Illusions are not malfunctions but demonstrations that the inference process can be fooled. They show that perception is constructed, not given.

### 2025-12-30 - The Kantian Connection

Helmholtz was deeply influenced by Kant but transformed his ideas:

| Kant | Helmholtz |
|------|-----------|
| Categories are a priori | Categories are learned |
| Space and time are forms of intuition (innate) | Even spatial perception is empirical |
| Noumena unknowable | Agrees: we only know signs, not things |
| Transcendental idealism | Empirical naturalism |

Helmholtz took Kant's insight that we don't perceive things-in-themselves and grounded it in physiology. The "veil of perception" is not metaphysical but neurological.

### 2025-12-30 - Sign Theory (Zeichentheorie)

**Core Claim**: Sensations are not copies or images of external reality but signs that stand in for external causes.

**The Telegraph Analogy**: Helmholtz compared nerve fibers to telegraph wires. The message received depends not on what hits the wire but on the apparatus at the receiving end.

**Implications**:
- No privileged access to reality
- Perception is functional, not metaphysically accurate
- Different senses give different "signs" for the same reality
- Learning involves correlating signs across modalities

**Connection to Friston**: This anticipates the idea that the brain maintains a generative model—a system of signs—that is updated to minimize prediction error. The "signs" are the parameters of the model.

### 2025-12-30 - Why Helmholtz Matters for FEP

1. **Historical Priority**: Helmholtz coined "unconscious inference" in 1867. Without him, there is no predictive processing tradition.

2. **Empirical Grounding**: Helmholtz was not just a philosopher but an experimental scientist. His theory was based on actual measurements of nerve conduction, visual phenomena, etc.

3. **Naturalization of Epistemology**: By showing that perception is physiologically constructed, Helmholtz opened the door to treating knowledge as a natural phenomenon.

4. **Resistance to Innativism**: His emphasis on learning through experience aligns with the FEP view that generative models are acquired, not hardwired.

## Open Questions

- [ ] How did Helmholtz reconcile his empiricism with his Kantian commitments?
- [ ] What exactly did he mean by "inference"? Was it Bayesian in the modern sense?
- [ ] How did his theory influence Wundt and the founding of experimental psychology?
- [ ] Are there primary source translations of the key sections of Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik?
