## Connection Summary

Helmholtz occupies a crucial position in the intellectual history relevant to this repository:

```
Kant (1724-1804)
    ↓ (philosophical influence)
Helmholtz (1821-1894)
    ↓ (unconscious inference → predictive processing)
    ├→ Wundt (experimental psychology)
    ├→ Gregory (perceptual hypotheses)
    └→ Friston (Free Energy Principle)
```

His "unconscious inference" concept is the single most important historical precursor to Friston's Free Energy Principle and the entire predictive processing research program.
