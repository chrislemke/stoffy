## Reading Notes

### 2025-12-30 - Das Kapital, Volume 1 (1867)

**Key Insights**:

1. **The Commodity as Starting Point**: Marx begins with the commodity because it is the "cell-form" of capitalist society. Every commodity has a dual character:
   - **Use-value**: Qualitative, satisfies human needs
   - **Exchange-value**: Quantitative, relates to other commodities

2. **Value and Abstract Labor**: What makes commodities commensurable is not their concrete useful properties but the abstract human labor congealed in them. Value is a social relation appearing as a natural property of things.

3. **The Fetishism of Commodities (Ch. 1.4)**:
   - The "mystical character" of the commodity: relations between producers appear as relations between products
   - The social character of labor is invisible in the market
   - Fetishism is not illusion but objective social structure
   - Connects to alienation: the product dominates the producer

4. **Money as Universal Equivalent**: Money is a commodity that expresses the value of all others. The money-form is the developed form of value relations.

5. **The Circuit M-C-M'**: Capital's formula. Unlike C-M-C (selling to buy), M-C-M' (buying to sell at profit) has no natural limit. Capital is value in motion, self-expanding value.

6. **Surplus Value Production**:
   - Workers sell labor-power (capacity to work), not labor itself
   - Value of labor-power = labor needed to reproduce worker
   - Workers work longer than needed to reproduce themselves
   - The difference = surplus value, appropriated by capital

7. **Primitive Accumulation (Part 8)**: The historical presupposition of capitalism - violent separation of producers from means of production. Enclosures, colonialism, slavery. "Capital comes dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt."

**Questions Raised**:
- Is the labor theory of value descriptive or critical?
- How does commodity fetishism relate to ideology?
- Can exploitation exist without labor theory of value (cf. Roemer)?

**Connection to My Thinking**:
The commodity fetishism chapter is remarkable for anticipating phenomenological themes. Social relations appearing as thing-relations resonates with reification (Lukács) and with questions about how social structure shapes perception.

### 2025-12-30 - Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844

**Key Insights**:

1. **Four Forms of Alienation**:
   - From product: What I create confronts me as alien power
   - From labor process: Work is external, forced, not self-expression
   - From species-being: Human creative essence denied
   - From other humans: Competition replaces solidarity

2. **Species-Being (Gattungswesen)**: Humans distinguished by conscious, purposive, creative production. We make our life-activity the object of our will. Under capitalism, this capacity is stunted - we work to live rather than living in work.

3. **Critique of Private Property**: Private property is not the cause but the consequence of alienated labor. Abolishing property without overcoming alienation would be "crude communism" (equal immiseration).

4. **Humanism and Naturalism**: Marx's vision of communism as the resolution of the conflict between essence and existence, freedom and necessity, individual and species.

**Questions Raised**:
- Is species-being a metaphysical concept that mature Marx abandons?
- Can alienation be overcome within capitalism (reforms) or only by abolishing it?
- How does alienation relate to the "hard problem" of consciousness?

**Connection to My Thinking**:
The 1844 Manuscripts are the most "philosophical" Marx - before he turned to political economy. The question of whether this humanist framework persists in Capital is central to interpretation.

### 2025-12-30 - The German Ideology (1846)

**Key Insights**:

1. **First Statement of Historical Materialism**:
   - "It is not consciousness that determines life, but life that determines consciousness"
   - Production of material life is foundational
   - Ideas, culture, religion are superstructural

2. **Critique of Ideology**:
   - The *camera obscura* metaphor: ideology inverts reality
   - Ruling ideas = ideas of ruling class
   - Ideology presents particular (class) interests as universal

3. **Division of Labor**:
   - Basis of class society
   - Mental vs. manual labor split
   - Creates appearance of autonomous thought

4. **Communism as Movement**: "Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things."

**Questions Raised**:
- Is all thought ideological, or is there a standpoint of truth?
- How does the proletariat escape ideology?
- What remains of ideology critique after "end of metanarratives"?

### 2025-12-30 - The Communist Manifesto (1848)

**Key Insights**:

1. **Class Struggle as Historical Motor**: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."

2. **Bourgeoisie as Revolutionary Class**:
   - Created world market, massive productive forces
   - Dissolved feudal relations
   - "All that is solid melts into air"

3. **Proletariat as Universal Class**:
   - Has nothing to lose but chains
   - Cannot liberate itself without liberating all
   - Revolutionary negation of existing order

4. **Ten-Point Program**: Graduated income tax, free education, centralization of credit, etc. Many demands now mainstream in capitalist democracies.

**Questions Raised**:
- Has the proletariat been dissolved by consumerism, identity politics, or precarity?
- Is the bourgeoisie still revolutionary or now purely reactionary?
- Does globalization confirm or refute Marx's predictions?

## Key Concepts Deep Dive

### German Terminology and FEP Parallels

| German Term | English | Definition | FEP Parallel? |
|-------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Entfremdung** | Alienation | Separation from essence; product confronts producer as alien power | Chronic prediction error? Mismatch between generative model and world? |
| **Gattungswesen** | Species-being | Human capacity for free, conscious, creative activity | Generative model of "human" functioning? Deep prior? |
| **Mehrwert** | Surplus Value | Value produced by worker above reproduction cost; source of profit | — |
| **Warenfetischismus** | Commodity Fetishism | Social relations appearing as relations between things | Misattribution of causes? Occluded inference? |
| **Verdinglichung** | Reification | (Lukács's term) Treating processes/relations as static things | Model rigidity? Failed model updating? |
| **Ideologie** | Ideology | Ideas that serve class interests while appearing universal | Inherited priors serving dominant interests? |
| **Praxis** | Praxis | Unity of theory and practice; transformative action | Active inference - changing world to match model |
| **Basis/Überbau** | Base/Superstructure | Economic foundation vs. legal/political/cultural edifice | — |
| **Produktionsverhältnisse** | Relations of Production | Property relations, class structure, social organization of labor | — |
| **Produktivkräfte** | Forces of Production | Technology, labor power, knowledge, raw materials | — |

### The Praxis-Active Inference Connection

The most promising FEP parallel is **praxis as active inference**:

- Marx: Humans don't merely interpret the world; they transform it
- Friston: Organisms don't merely passively model the world; they act to make the world conform to their predictions

Both reject pure contemplation in favor of world-directed action. The 11th Thesis on Feuerbach ("philosophers have only interpreted... the point is to change it") maps onto the active inference framework where action is integral to cognition.

**Caution**: These parallels risk anachronism. Marx's concepts emerge from Hegelian dialectics and political economy, not computational neuroscience. The structural isomorphism shouldn't collapse historical specificity.

## Commentarial Traditions

### Orthodox Marxism (Second International)

**Key Figures**: Karl Kautsky, Georgi Plekhanov, Eduard Bernstein

**Characteristics**:
- Scientific socialism as laws of historical development
- Economic determinism: base strictly determines superstructure
- Evolutionary view: capitalism will collapse under own contradictions
- Revisionism debate: Bernstein argued for gradual reform

**Critique**: Mechanical interpretation; neglects agency and consciousness

### Western Marxism

**Key Figures**: György Lukács, Antonio Gramsci, Frankfurt School (Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse)

**Characteristics**:
- Recovery of Hegelian dimension after 1844 Manuscripts published
- Focus on consciousness, culture, ideology
- Lukács: Reification as central concept; proletarian standpoint
- Gramsci: Hegemony - how ruling class maintains ideological consent

### Structuralist Marxism

**Key Figures**: Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar, Nicos Poulantzas

**Characteristics**:
- Anti-humanist reading: rejects "species-being," alienation

- Althusser & Balibar, *Reading Capital* (1965)
- Althusser, "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" (1970)

**Critique**: Was Althusser too influenced by structuralism's ahistoricism?

### Analytical Marxism

**Key Figures**: G.A. Cohen, Jon Elster, John Roemer, Erik Olin Wright

**Characteristics**:
- Commitment to clarity, rigor, non-bullshit
- Use of rational choice theory, game theory, analytical philosophy
- Cohen: Functional explanation defense of historical materialism
- Roemer: Exploitation without labor theory of value
- Wright: Class as multidimensional

**Key Works**:
- Cohen, *Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence* (1978)
- Elster, *Making Sense of Marx* (1985)
- Roemer, *A General Theory of Exploitation and Class* (1982)

**Critique**: Does analytical clarity strip away dialectical insight?

## Open Research Questions

- [ ] **Reification and Commodity Fetishism**: How precisely do Lukács's concept and Marx's relate? Is reification broader?

- [ ] **Marx's Theory of Ideology**: Beyond "false consciousness" - what is the epistemological status of ideology? Can there be proletarian ideology?

- [ ] **Historical Materialism and Agency**: Does determination "in the last instance" leave room for genuine historical agency? How does class consciousness emerge?

- [ ] **Late Marx's Anthropological Turn**: The Ethnological Notebooks (1880-82) suggest multilinear history, not universal stages. Implications for Eurocentrism critique?

- [ ] **Value-Form and Labor Theory**: Is Marx's point about value descriptive (how prices form) or critical (how capitalism mystifies)? Does exploitation require labor theory?

- [ ] **Marx and Ecology**: Was Marx an ecological thinker avant la lettre? Can Marxism ground environmental politics?

- [ ] **Alienation and FEP**: Can we give a naturalistic account of alienation using free energy minimization? Is this illuminating or reductive?
