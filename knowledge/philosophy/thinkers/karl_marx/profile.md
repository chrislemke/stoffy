Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) was Marx's intellectual partner, financial supporter, and co-author. Their collaboration produced foundational Marxist texts. After Marx's death, Engels edited *Capital* Volumes 2-3 and systematized Marxist theory (though some scholars question whether Engels's interpretations fully represent Marx's views).

## Core Ideas

### A. Ontology & Philosophical Anthropology (Early Marx)

- **Species-Being (Gattungswesen)**: Humans are distinguished from animals by their capacity for free, conscious, creative activity. Our "species-essence" is realized through productive, purposive transformation of nature. Under capitalism, this essence is denied and distorted.

- **Alienation (Entfremdung)**: The central concept of Marx's early work, developed in the 1844 Manuscripts. Under capitalism, workers experience four dimensions of alienation:
  1. **From the product**: What workers create becomes a hostile, alien power (capital)
  2. **From the labor process**: Work is not self-expression but coerced drudgery
  3. **From species-being**: Creative human potential is reduced to mere survival
  4. **From other humans**: Competition replaces solidarity; social bonds become instrumental

  Alienation is not merely subjective feeling but objective structural condition.

- **Praxis**: The unity of theory and practice. Against contemplative philosophy, Marx insists that humans are primarily practical beings who transform their world. The famous Eleventh Thesis on Feuerbach: philosophers have only *interpreted* the world; the point is to *change* it.

- **Historical Materialism (early formulation)**: Consciousness does not determine life; life determines consciousness. The production of material life is the foundation upon which ideas, culture, and institutions arise. This inverts Hegel's idealism while preserving his dialectical method.

### B. Political Economy (Mature Marx)

- **Labor Theory of Value**: The value of commodities is determined by the socially necessary labor time required for their production. This builds on Ricardo but is used to reveal exploitation hidden within apparently free market exchange.

- **Surplus Value (Mehrwert)**: The key to capitalist exploitation. Workers produce more value than they receive in wages. The difference - surplus value - is appropriated by capitalists. This is the source of profit, rent, and interest. Marx distinguishes:
  - **Absolute surplus value**: Extending the working day
  - **Relative surplus value**: Intensifying labor through technology and organization

- **Commodity Fetishism (Warenfetischismus)**: One of Marx's most profound insights. Under capitalism, social relations between people appear as relations between things (commodities). The social character of production is masked, making capitalism appear natural and eternal rather than historical and changeable. The commodity form has a "mystical character" that conceals the labor relations behind it.

- **Capital as Self-Valorizing Value**: Capital is not a thing but a social relation and a process. The formula M-C-M' (money → commodity → more money) captures capital's endless drive for accumulation. Capital is "dead labor" that "vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor."

- **The General Formula of Capital**: M-C-M' versus simple commodity circulation C-M-C. In the latter, money mediates exchange of use-values. In capitalism, commodities mediate the expansion of value. This inversion reveals capitalism's peculiar logic.

- **Primitive Accumulation**: Capital's historical origins lie not in frugality and hard work but in violence: enclosures, colonialism, slavery, state power. The separation of producers from means of production was achieved through "conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder."

- **Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall**: As capitalists increase organic composition of capital (more machinery, less living labor), the source of surplus value shrinks relative to investment. This generates systemic crises, though Marx notes various "counter-tendencies."

### C. Historical Materialism (Mature Formulation)

- **Base and Superstructure**: The economic structure of society (relations of production) forms the "real foundation" upon which rises a legal and political superstructure. Social being determines consciousness, not vice versa. The 1859 Preface to *Contribution to Critique of Political Economy* is the classic statement.

- **Mode of Production**: The combination of:
  - **Forces of production**: Technology, labor power, raw materials, knowledge
  - **Relations of production**: Property relations, class structure, social organization of labor

  Historical epochs are defined by their dominant mode of production.

- **Class Struggle**: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." Classes are defined by relation to means of production. Under capitalism: bourgeoisie (owners) vs. proletariat (wage laborers). Class conflict is the motor of historical change.

- **Ideology**: Ideas, culture, religion, philosophy are not autonomous but arise from and serve material interests. The ruling ideas of any epoch are the ideas of the ruling class. The *camera obscura* metaphor: ideology inverts reality, presenting effects as causes, particular interests as universal.

- **Historical Stages**: Marx sketches a sequence (though not a rigid schema):
  - Asiatic mode of production (controversial)
  - Ancient (slavery-based)
  - Feudal (serfdom)
  - Capitalist (wage labor)
  - Communist (classless)

### D. Revolutionary Theory

- **Dictatorship of the Proletariat**: The transitional state between capitalism and communism. The working class seizes political power to suppress bourgeois counter-revolution and reorganize production. Not dictatorship by one person but class rule - analogous to bourgeois "dictatorship" under capitalism.

- **Withering Away of the State**: The state is an instrument of class domination. With the abolition of classes, the state loses its function and gradually dissolves. Governance of persons gives way to administration of things.

- **Class Consciousness**: Distinction between:
  - **Class-in-itself** (Klasse an sich): Objective position in production
  - **Class-for-itself** (Klasse für sich): Self-conscious, organized political agent

  Revolution requires the proletariat's self-conscious recognition of its historical mission.

- **Revolution and Historical Necessity**: Marx wavers between voluntarism (conscious revolutionary action) and determinism (capitalism's internal contradictions lead inevitably to collapse). This tension animates later Marxist debates. Revolutions occur when relations of production become "fetters" on further development of productive forces.

## The "Two Marxes" Debate

A fundamental interpretive controversy concerns the relationship between Marx's early writings (pre-1845) and mature works (*Capital*).

### The Humanist Reading

**Proponents**: György Lukács, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Raya Dunayevskaya

- Emphasizes continuity with the 1844 Manuscripts
- Alienation remains central even in *Capital* (commodity fetishism = alienation in economic form)
- Marx is fundamentally a philosopher of human self-realization and emancipation
- Socialism is about overcoming alienation, not just economic restructuring
- The "economic" Marx cannot be separated from the "humanist" Marx

### The Scientific Reading

**Proponents**: Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar

- Posits an "epistemological break" (coupure épistémologique) around 1845
- Early writings are ideological, still trapped in Feuerbachian humanism
- Mature Marx abandons concepts like "essence," "species-being," "alienation"
- *Capital* is a work of science, not philosophy - it discovers the laws of motion of capitalism
- Reading humanist themes into *Capital* is a regression to ideology

### Continuity Thesis

**Proponents**: Bertell Ollman, István Mészáros, David Harvey

- Acknowledge development but reject sharp break
- Commodity fetishism in *Capital* is the mature form of alienation analysis
- Marx's critique of political economy presupposes normative commitments about human flourishing
- The absence of "alienation" vocabulary doesn't mean the concept disappears
- Even "scientific" Marx retains revolutionary and critical intent

**This profile presents both views without resolution, recognizing this as a live scholarly debate.**

## Connections to Other Thinkers

### Direct Influences

- **[G.W.F. Hegel](../georg_wilhelm_friedrich_hegel/)**: Marx inverted Hegel's idealism into materialism while retaining dialectical method. Where Hegel saw history driven by Spirit's self-realization, Marx saw it driven by material production and class struggle. The master-slave dialectic reappears as capital-labor relation.

- **Ludwig Feuerbach**: Feuerbach's critique of religion as human self-projection influenced Marx's early thought. But the *Theses on Feuerbach* criticize Feuerbach's contemplative, ahistorical materialism: "the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual."

- **Friedrich Engels**: Lifelong collaborator, co-author of *Manifesto*, *German Ideology*, *Holy Family*. Engels provided financial support, contributed independently (especially on natural science, military affairs), and posthumously edited *Capital* Vols. 2-3. Some scholars distinguish "Engels's Marxism" from Marx's own thought.

### Critical Engagements

- **Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**: Early influence, then target of *Poverty of Philosophy*. Marx rejected Proudhon's mutualism and criticized his economic confusions while engaging seriously with his critique of property.

- **Mikhail Bakunin**: Anarchist rival in the First International. Debates about state, authority, and revolutionary organization. Bakunin warned Marx's "dictatorship of proletariat" would become dictatorship over proletariat.

- **Max Stirner**: Target of extensive critique in *German Ideology*. Stirner's radical individualism ("The Ego and Its Own") represented opposite extreme from Marx's social ontology.

### Later Development

- **György Lukács**: *History and Class Consciousness* (1923) recovered Hegelian Marx; concepts of reification, totality, class consciousness. Influenced Western Marxism.

- **Antonio Gramsci**: *Prison Notebooks* developed hegemony, civil society, organic intellectuals. Marxism as "philosophy of praxis." Crucial for understanding ideology beyond "false consciousness."

- **Theodor Adorno & Max Horkheimer**: Frankfurt School critical theory. *Dialectic of Enlightenment* extended critique of instrumental reason. Adorno's *Negative Dialectics* preserved Marx's critical impulse against positive philosophy.

- **Louis Althusser**: Structuralist reading of *Capital*; epistemological break; ideology as material practice; anti-humanism. Highly influential in 1960s-70s, now contested.

- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: Attempted synthesis of Marxism and existentialism in *Critique of Dialectical Reason*. Marx provides history, Sartre provides individual praxis.

### Contemporary Dialogue

- **[Karl Friston](../karl_friston/)**: Speculative connection - see Reflections. Praxis as active inference? Alienation as chronic prediction error? Ideology as inherited (maladaptive) priors?

- **David Harvey**: Geographer and Marxist theorist; spatial fix; accumulation by dispossession; close reader of *Capital*. Lectures widely available.

- **Slavoj Žižek**: Lacanian-Hegelian Marxist; ideology critique through psychoanalysis; symptom as return of repressed. Provocative contemporary voice.

## Relevance to My Thinking

### Connection to Free Will and Determinism

Marx's work directly engages the structure-agency problem. Historical materialism seems deterministic (material conditions shape consciousness), yet Marx insists on revolutionary praxis and human self-creation. The tension between "circumstances make humans" and "humans make circumstances" remains philosophically productive.

**Key question**: How does Marx's "determination in the last instance by the economic" relate to contemporary debates about free will? Is ideology a form of unfreedom compatible with determinism?

### Alienation and Authenticity

The early Marx's alienation theory resonates with existentialist concerns about authenticity. But Marx locates alienation not in the human condition as such but in historically specific social relations. This offers a more actionable diagnosis: alienation can be overcome through social transformation, not merely individual self-realization.

**Synthesis opportunity**: How does alienation relate to Sartrean bad faith? To Heidegger's inauthenticity? To Friston's prediction error?

### Ideology and Belief Formation

Marx's theory of ideology - how material interests shape ideas - anticipates contemporary concerns in epistemology and cognitive science. The "camera obscura" metaphor suggests systematic distortion in human self-understanding.

**Open question**: Can ideology critique be naturalized? Does predictive processing offer a framework for understanding how social position shapes belief?

### Critique of Capitalism

Even setting aside Marx's revolutionary conclusions, his *description* of capitalism remains powerful: the commodity form, fetishism, the M-C-M' circuit, alienated labor. These analytical tools illuminate contemporary economic life.

**Personal stake**: What remains living in Marx's critique? What must be revised given capitalism's transformations since 1867?
