## Reading Notes

### 2025-12-26 - The Mind is Flat

**Key Insight**: The flat mind thesis is not merely a claim about cognitive architecture—it's an ontological claim about the nature of mental states. There are no beliefs "in" the mind; there are only momentary acts of believing. This transforms psychology from archaeology to improvisational theater.

**Questions Raised**:
- How does long-term memory fit into this picture? Are stored memories not a form of "depth"?
- What about unconscious priming effects? Does Chater explain these away?
- Is the flat mind compatible with predictive processing (Active Inference)?
- If beliefs are improvised, what about mathematical knowledge or procedural skills?

**Connection to My Thinking**:
- Direct support for "self as function, not state"
- Potential tension with Active Inference's generative models
- Raises question: Can the flat mind thesis itself be a stable belief?

### 2025-12-26 - Visual Illusions as Evidence

**Key Insight**: Chater uses visual illusions not just as curiosities but as windows into the constructive nature of all cognition. If perception is construction, and all cognition extends from perception, then all cognition is construction.

**Specific Examples**:
- Change blindness: We don't represent the visual scene in detail; we construct what we need when we need it
- Hollow face illusion: Top-down expectations override bottom-up signals
- Filling-in phenomena: The brain invents details that aren't sensed

**Implication**: Introspection is no more reliable than perception—both are constructions, not observations.

## Reflections

### 2025-12-26 - The Liberation of Flatness

Chater's thesis is initially disturbing—if there's no deep self, what are we? But on reflection, it's liberating:

1. **No authentic self to betray**: If there's no hidden true self, we cannot fail to be who we really are
2. **Freedom to improvise**: Every moment is an opportunity to create ourselves anew
3. **End of futile introspection**: We can stop digging for truths that aren't there

This aligns with existentialist themes (Sartre's "existence precedes essence") but grounds them in cognitive science rather than phenomenology.
