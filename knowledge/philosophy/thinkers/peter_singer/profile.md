# Thinker Profile: Peter Singer

**Type**: philosopher
**Era**: Contemporary (1946-)
**Traditions**: Utilitarianism, Preference Utilitarianism, Analytic Philosophy

## Core Ideas

- **Equal Consideration of Interests**: The interests of all sentient beings deserve equal moral consideration, regardless of species, race, sex, or other morally irrelevant characteristics. This principle grounds both animal ethics and global justice.

- **Speciesism**: Giving greater moral weight to members of one's own species is an arbitrary prejudice analogous to racism or sexism. Species membership alone provides no basis for differential moral treatment.

- **The Drowning Child Analogy**: If you would save a drowning child at minimal cost to yourself, consistency requires helping distant strangers in comparable need. Geographic distance does not diminish moral obligation.

- **Effective Altruism**: We should use evidence and reason to determine how to benefit others as much as possible, then act accordingly. Not all charitable giving is equally effective; we should maximize the good our resources can do.

- **Preference Utilitarianism (earlier) / Hedonistic Utilitarianism (later)**: Initially, Singer held that the right action maximizes the satisfaction of preferences. He later shifted toward hedonistic utilitarianism, holding that we should maximize the balance of pleasure over pain.

- **Applied Ethics Methodology**: Ethical reflection should engage with real-world problems - poverty, animal suffering, euthanasia, environmental destruction - not just abstract puzzles. Philosophy should make a practical difference.

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "If we are in a position to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it." - "Famine, Affluence, and Morality"

> "All the arguments to prove man's superiority cannot shatter this hard fact: in suffering the animals are our equals." - *Animal Liberation*

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **R. M. Hare**: Singer's doctoral advisor at Oxford; Hare's universal prescriptivism influenced Singer's approach to moral reasoning and the universalizability of ethical judgments.

- **Jeremy Bentham**: Singer continues the Benthamite utilitarian tradition, famously echoing Bentham's question about animals: "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"

- **John Rawls**: Singer has engaged critically with Rawlsian contractarianism, arguing it cannot adequately ground obligations to non-human animals or distant strangers.

- **Tom Regan**: Fellow animal ethicist; while Regan defends animal rights based on inherent value, Singer grounds animal ethics in utilitarian concern for suffering, leading to different practical conclusions.
