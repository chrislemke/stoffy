# Thinker Profile: Albert Camus

**Type**: Philosopher, Novelist, Dramatist
**Era**: Contemporary (1913-1960)
**Traditions**: Absurdism, Continental Philosophy

## Core Ideas

- **The Absurd**: The fundamental conflict between human beings' natural desire for meaning, clarity, and purpose, and the universe's silent indifference. The absurd is not in the world or in humanity alone, but in their confrontation.

- **Philosophical Suicide**: Religion and philosophical systems that claim to resolve the absurd through transcendent meaning or rationalist explanations are forms of "philosophical suicide" - they evade rather than confront the fundamental condition.

- **Revolt**: The authentic response to absurdity is neither suicide nor hope, but revolt - a continuous defiance that affirms life precisely because it lacks ultimate justification. Living fully in the face of meaninglessness.

- **Sisyphus as Hero**: The figure of Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boulder uphill eternally, represents the human condition. We must imagine Sisyphus happy because he accepts his fate and finds meaning in the struggle itself.

- **Limits of Rebellion**: While revolt is necessary, it must recognize moral limits. In The Rebel, Camus argues that rebellion in the name of justice can become tyrannical murder if it loses sight of the human beings it claims to serve.

- **Solidarity in Mortality**: Shared mortality and vulnerability create bonds of human solidarity. The absurd, properly understood, leads not to nihilism but to compassion and commitment to alleviating suffering.

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: Initially close ally in post-war French intellectual life, their friendship ruptured over political differences, particularly regarding communism and revolutionary violence.

- **Fyodor Dostoevsky**: Literary and philosophical inspiration, especially the analysis of nihilism and the question of whether everything is permitted without God.

- **Jean Grenier**: Camus's philosophy teacher who introduced him to Greek philosophy and Nietzsche, profoundly shaping his intellectual development.
