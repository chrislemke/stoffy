# Thinker Profile: Daniel Dennett

**Type**: philosopher
**Era**: Contemporary (1942-2024)
**Traditions**: Functionalism, Naturalism, Analytic Philosophy, New Atheism

## Core Ideas

- **Heterophenomenology**: A method for studying consciousness from a third-person perspective that takes first-person reports seriously as data without granting them incorrigible authority. We can study what people believe about their experiences without assuming those beliefs are accurate.

- **The Multiple Drafts Model**: Consciousness is not a unified "Cartesian theater" where experiences are presented to a central observer. Instead, the brain continuously generates multiple parallel interpretations of sensory data, with no single authoritative "final" version.

- **The Intentional Stance**: We predict and explain behavior by attributing beliefs, desires, and intentions to systems - humans, animals, computers. This stance is useful and predictive, but does not commit us to "original" intentionality as something metaphysically special.

- **Compatibilist Free Will**: Free will is compatible with determinism when properly understood. Freedom is not about escaping causation but about having the right kinds of capacities for rational self-control. "Freedom Evolves" shows how complex organisms develop genuine autonomy.

- **Universal Acid (Darwin's Dangerous Idea)**: Natural selection is an algorithmic process so powerful it dissolves traditional boundaries between mind and matter, purpose and mechanism. Evolution provides a naturalistic explanation for design without a designer.

- **Intuition Pumps**: Dennett coined this term for thought experiments that pump intuitions in certain directions. Philosophy should be aware of how these work and deploy them carefully, as many are misleading.

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "A philosopher is someone who says, 'We know it's possible in practice; we're trying to find out if it's possible in principle.'" - *Consciousness Explained*

> "The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it." - *Breaking the Spell*

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Gilbert Ryle**: Dennett's doctoral advisor at Oxford; Ryle's critique of the "ghost in the machine" profoundly shaped Dennett's anti-Cartesian approach to consciousness.

- **Thomas Nagel**: Intellectual opponent; while Nagel defends the irreducibility of subjective experience, Dennett argues that "qualia" and the "hard problem" rest on philosophical confusions.

- **Richard Dawkins**: Ally in evolutionary theory and New Atheism; Dennett's philosophical defense of natural selection complements Dawkins's biological expositions.

- **Douglas Hofstadter**: Longtime collaborator; shared interests in recursion, self-reference, and the emergence of mind from simple processes. Co-edited *The Mind's I*.
