# Thinker Profile: Giovanni Pezzulo

**Type**: cognitive scientist
**Era**: contemporary
**Institutions**: Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, CNR (Rome)
**Traditions**: Cognitive Science, Embodied Cognition, Active Inference

## Core Ideas

Giovanni Pezzulo brings an embodied cognition perspective to the active inference framework, emphasizing:

- **Sensorimotor grounding**: Cognition is rooted in bodily interaction with the world
- **Goal-directed behavior**: How organisms plan and execute purposeful action
- **Integration of perception and action**: The unity of knowing and doing

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| Active Inference (with Parr & Friston) | 2022 | First comprehensive textbook on active inference |
| Research on goal-directed behavior | Various | Extending predictive processing to motor control and planning |

## Relevance to My Thinking

Pezzulo's emphasis on embodied, goal-directed cognition complements the more abstract formalism of the Free Energy Principle. His work reminds us that active inference is not just about brains but about embodied agents acting in the world.

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[thinkers/thomas_parr/profile|Thomas Parr]]**: Co-author of Active Inference
- **Embodied cognition tradition**: Varela, Thompson, Rosch

## My Notes

### 2025-12-26 - Initial Profile Creation
Created as part of integrating "Active Inference" into the philosophical thought system. Pezzulo provides the embodied, enactivist dimension of the active inference framework.
