# Reading Notes on Evan Thompson

## Mind in Life (2007)

### Central Thesis
Mind and life are more continuous than previously accepted. Where there is life, there is mind—understood as **sense-making**, the organism's adaptive engagement with its environment. This is not panpsychism; it's recognizing that even minimal life forms exhibit cognition in a basic sense.

### Key Concepts

#### Autopoiesis
Self-production. An autopoietic system is a network of processes that produces the components needed to maintain the network itself. It's not just homeostasis (maintaining variables within bounds) but self-constitution.

#### Sense-Making
The organism's significance-laden engagement with environment. Not representation but **enaction**. The bacterium moving toward nutrients is engaged in sense-making even without a nervous system.

#### Natural Autonomy
Self-determination and norm-governed behavior. Autonomous systems set their own norms (derived from self-maintenance) rather than having norms imposed from outside.

### Structure of the Book

Part I: Life - Autopoiesis and sense-making
Part II: Mind - Consciousness, emotion, selfhood
Part III: Method - Neurophenomenology

### Critical Points

1. **Against computationalism**: Mind is not symbol manipulation; it's embodied action
2. **Against eliminativism**: Phenomenology is ineliminable
3. **Against dualism**: Mind-life continuity dissolves the gap
4. **For integration**: First-person and third-person methods together

## The Embodied Mind (1991/2017)

### Revolutionary Moves

1. **Reject cognitivism**: The mind is not a computer processing representations
2. **Embrace phenomenology**: First-person experience matters for science
3. **Bring in Buddhism**: Mindfulness traditions offer insight into the mind
4. **Propose enaction**: Cognition is embodied action, not passive reception

### The Mindfulness Connection

Thompson, Varela, and Rosch were influenced by contemplative traditions, especially Buddhism. Key Buddhist insights:
- No-self (anatta): The self is constructed, not found
- Dependent origination: Nothing exists independently
- Mindfulness: First-person investigation of experience

These aren't add-ons but central to the enactive view.

## Life and Mind: Tribute to Varela (2004)

### From Autopoiesis to Neurophenomenology

Thompson traces Varela's development:
1. **Autopoiesis** (1970s): Definition of life as self-production
2. **Autonomy** (1980s): Norm-governed, self-determining systems
3. **Enaction** (1990s): Cognition as bringing forth a world
4. **Neurophenomenology** (1996): Integrating phenomenology and neuroscience

### The Hard Problem Reconsidered

Varela and Thompson don't directly solve Chalmers's hard problem. Instead, they reframe it:
- Not: Why is there experience at all?
- But: How does living subjectivity emerge from living being?

The goal is understanding emergence, not bridging an impossible gap.

## Waking, Dreaming, Being (2014)

### Consciousness Across States

Thompson examines consciousness in:
- Waking: Ordinary awareness
- Dreaming: Lucid and non-lucid dreams
- Deep sleep: Is there consciousness without content?
- Meditation: Altered states and insights

### Key Themes

1. **The self is constructed**: In all states, selfhood is a process, not a thing
2. **Consciousness is graded**: Not an all-or-nothing phenomenon
3. **Contemplative traditions have data**: Buddhist and yogic traditions offer empirical insights

## Connections to FEP/Active Inference

### Convergences

- **Markov blankets ≈ Autopoiesis**: Both define the boundary of self-organization
- **Active inference ≈ Enaction**: Both emphasize action and prediction
- **Self-evidencing ≈ Autonomy**: Systems maintain their existence through activity

### Tensions

- **Representation**: Friston sometimes uses representational language; Thompson rejects it
- **Formalism**: FEP is mathematical; Thompson emphasizes phenomenological description
- **Internal models**: FEP speaks of "generative models"; Thompson might resist this

### Synthesis Attempts

Ramstead et al. (2020): "A tale of two densities" argues active inference IS enactive inference. This is the key synthesis paper connecting Thompson's philosophy with Friston's formalism.

## Key Quotes

> "Where there is life there is mind: life and mind share common principles of self-organization."

> "Cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs."

> "Living is cognition."

## Questions for Further Research

1. How exactly do FEP and enactivism relate? Is Ramstead's synthesis complete?
2. What happens to phenomenology in the mathematical formalism?
3. Can AI be enactive, or does it require biological embodiment?
4. How does contemplative experience inform cognitive science concretely?
