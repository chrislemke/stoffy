# Reading Notes on Maxwell Ramstead

## "A tale of two densities: active inference is enactive inference" (2020)

### Main Argument
Active inference has been misinterpreted as a form of representationalism due to conflation with predictive processing. Properly understood, it is inherently enactive—the organism doesn't passively model the world but actively brings it about through engagement.

### Two Densities
1. **Recognition density**: The organism's beliefs about hidden states
2. **Generative density**: The statistical model of how states generate observations

The key insight: these densities are not internal representations of external reality. They are constitutive of the organism's engagement with its environment.

### Against Representationalism
Standard view: The brain builds internal models that represent the external world.
Ramstead's view: The "model" is the organism's way of being-in-the-world, not a copy of something separate.

### Implications
- Active inference doesn't require representations in the traditional sense
- The organism and environment are co-constituting
- Prediction is for action, not for matching internal to external

## Computational Phenomenology Papers

### Core Framework
1. **Phenomenological descriptions** (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) provide structural analyses of experience
2. **Active inference** provides formal/mathematical models
3. **Neuroscience** provides mechanistic implementation

Computational phenomenology connects all three levels.

### Time-Consciousness Modeling
Husserl's analysis:
- Retention: Just-past held in current experience
- Primal impression: The "living present"
- Protention: Anticipation of just-about-to-come

Active inference mapping:
- Retention → Posterior beliefs after observation
- Primal impression → Sensory prediction error
- Protention → Prior predictions about future states

### Applications
- Meditation and meta-awareness modeling
- Attentional control
- Shared social cognition

## Multiscale Integration

### The Problem
Internalism: Mind is in the head
Externalism: Mind extends beyond the head

Both frame it as either/or.

### Ramstead's Solution
Markov blankets exist at multiple scales:
- Cellular Markov blankets
- Organismic Markov blankets
- Social Markov blankets (groups as agents)

The question isn't where the boundary is, but which scale of analysis you're using.

### Implications
- No single "correct" boundary for mind
- Integration across scales is the key phenomenon
- Nested hierarchies of agency

## Key Quotes

> "Active inference is enactive inference."

> "The state of the external world is never directly perceived, but is instead something the organism infers and brings about actively."

> "Computational phenomenology's core assumption is that Bayesian belief updating... can be employed to model first-person phenomenology."

## Connections to Other Readings

- **Friston**: Mathematical formalism that Ramstead interprets philosophically
- **Thompson**: Enactivism and life-mind continuity; Ramstead formalizes these insights
- **Hohwy**: Different emphasis—Hohwy more representationalist, Ramstead more enactive
- **Seth**: Both apply FEP to consciousness; Seth focuses on interoception, Ramstead on phenomenology
