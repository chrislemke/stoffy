# Reading Notes on Chris Fields

## "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" (2022)

### Core Reformulation
The FEP states: under suitable conditions of weak coupling, random dynamical systems with sufficient degrees of freedom behave to minimize an upper bound (variational free energy) on surprisal.

Fields reformulates this in quantum information theory:
- No spacetime background assumed
- Scale-free (works at any scale)
- Generic quantum systems (not just biological)

### Key Claims

1. **Separability = Observerhood**: Any quantum system that can be separated from its environment by a boundary IS an observer
2. **Boundary = Holographic screen**: The Markov blanket is physically a holographic screen encoding bits
3. **Freedom of choice → Agency**: With the standard quantum assumption of measurement choice, observers become agents
4. **Semantics from structure**: Agents assign meanings to observational outcomes automatically

### Holographic Screens

> "Boundaries that function as information channels are, when embedded in spacetime and constrained by general covariance, holographic screens that limit communication between the regions they separate to the bits that they encode."

This means: the bits on the screen ARE the interaction. There's nothing "behind" the screen.

### Implications for FEP

The FEP becomes a theorem about any quantum interaction:
- Quantum systems minimize surprisal by construction
- This isn't evolved; it's physically mandated
- Biology is a special case, not the general principle

## Quantum Reference Frames

### Why QRFs Matter

In classical physics, reference frames are abstract (coordinate systems).
In quantum theory, reference frames are physical systems that:
- Encode unmeasurable quantum phase
- Cannot be fully specified by any finite bit string
- Are "nonfungible" (irreplaceable)

### Consequences

1. **Observer-relativity is fundamental**: There is no "view from nowhere"
2. **Objectivity is approximation**: Works when systems are effectively classical
3. **Decoherence is measurement**: QRFs induce decoherence on holographic screens

### Symmetry Breaking

When we measure, our QRF breaks the symmetry of the holographic encoding. This is:
- Observer-relative (different observers, different breaks)
- Irreversible (classicality emerges)
- Information-constraining (limits what can be communicated)

## Physics as Information Processing

### Course Summary (Active Inference Institute, 2023)

Six sessions covering:
1. Physical interaction as communication
2. Physical systems as communicating agents
3. FEP and active inference for all physical systems
4. Quantum information theory as thinking tools
5. Scale-free principles
6. Implications for consciousness and cognition

### Key Pedagogical Points

- "Information" is not metaphorical but physical
- Shannon entropy connects to Boltzmann entropy
- Every physical interaction is an exchange of information
- Active inference is not just for brains—it's for quarks

## Inner Screen Hypothesis

### The Problem
How does subjective experience arise from physical processes?

### Fields' Proposal
The "inner screen" (what we experience as consciousness) follows directly from the quantum FEP structure:
- Every observer has a holographic screen boundary
- The screen encodes all accessible information
- What we call "experience" IS the screen encoding
- No additional mechanism needed

### 2025 Paper
"How do inner screens enable imaginative experience?"
- Applying FEP directly to conscious experience
- With Albarracin, Friston, Kiefer, Ramstead, Safron
- Published in Neuroscience of Consciousness

## Connections to Other Readings

- **Friston**: Fields extends Friston's biological formalism to physics
- **Hoffman**: Both reject naive realism; Hoffman's "interface" is Fields' holographic screen
- **Wheeler**: "It from bit" made mathematically precise
- **Ramstead**: Both work on FEP extensions; Ramstead focuses on phenomenology, Fields on physics
