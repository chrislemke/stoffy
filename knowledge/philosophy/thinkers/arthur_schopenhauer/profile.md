## Biography

### Early Life and Family
Arthur Schopenhauer was born on February 22, 1788, in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) into a wealthy patrician family of German and Dutch descent. His father, Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, was a successful merchant and admirer of Voltaire with a keen dislike of absolutist governments. When Danzig surrendered to the Prussians in 1793, the family moved to Hamburg. His mother, Johanna Schopenhauer, became a successful novelist and maintained a literary salon in Weimar attended by Goethe and other luminaries.

### Education and Early Career
After his father's death in 1805 (apparently by suicide), Schopenhauer was free to abandon the commercial career his father had planned for him and pursue philosophy. He studied at the University of Göttingen (1809-1811) and the University of Berlin (1811-1813), where he attended lectures by Fichte – whom he came to despise. His doctoral dissertation, *On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason* (1813), already displayed his systematic approach.

### The Masterwork
At age thirty, Schopenhauer published his magnum opus *Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung* (*The World as Will and Representation*, 1818). The work was almost completely ignored for decades. Only with the publication of *Parerga und Paralipomena* (1851) did he finally achieve fame in his sixties.

### The Failed Academic Career
In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the University of Berlin – where he deliberately scheduled his lectures at the same time as Hegel's. Students overwhelmingly chose Hegel. Schopenhauer never forgave Hegel, referring to him as a "clumsy charlatan" and "scribbler of nonsense." His academic career effectively ended after one semester.

### Frankfurt Years (1831-1860)
When cholera broke out in Berlin in 1831 (it killed Hegel), Schopenhauer fled to Frankfurt am Main, where he lived as a private scholar for the remaining twenty-nine years of his life. He followed a strict daily routine: writing in the morning, playing flute after lunch, walking with his poodle (all named "Atman" – Sanskrit for "world-soul"), dining at the Englischer Hof, and reading until bed. He was known for his misanthropy, yet was devoted to his succession of poodles.

### Death and Legacy
Schopenhauer died peacefully on September 21, 1860, in his apartment at Schöne Aussicht 16, Frankfurt. Despite decades of obscurity, his ideas profoundly influenced Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Freud, Wagner, Tolstoy, Thomas Mann, Proust, and many others.

## Core Ideas

- **The World as Will and Representation**: Reality has two aspects - the phenomenal world of representation (what we perceive) and the underlying noumenal reality which is blind, irrational Will. All phenomena are manifestations of this primal Will.

- **Will to Live (Wille zum Leben)**: The fundamental driving force of all existence is an insatiable, purposeless striving - the will to live. This ceaseless desire is the source of all suffering.

- **Philosophical Pessimism**: Life is characterized by suffering because desire is infinite while satisfaction is temporary. The best we can hope for is the mitigation of suffering, not happiness.

- **Aesthetic Contemplation as Escape**: Art and aesthetic experience offer temporary liberation from the tyranny of the will by allowing pure, will-less contemplation of Platonic Ideas.

- **Denial of the Will**: Ultimate salvation comes through the negation of the will to live - through asceticism, compassion, and the recognition that individuality is an illusion (principium individuationis).

- **Compassion as Moral Foundation**: Ethics is grounded in compassion (Mitleid), which arises from the recognition that the same Will animates all beings - the suffering of others is fundamentally our own suffering.

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason | 1813 | Doctoral thesis establishing the epistemological foundation for his system - four distinct forms of the principle of sufficient reason |
| The World as Will and Representation | 1818/1844 | Magnum opus presenting his complete metaphysical system of Will as the thing-in-itself behind all phenomena |
| On the Freedom of the Will | 1839 | Prize-winning essay arguing that while our actions follow from character with necessity, we remain responsible through what we are |
| On the Basis of Morality | 1840 | Grounds ethics in compassion rather than Kantian rational duty |
| Parerga and Paralipomena | 1851 | Collection of essays that brought him late fame; includes famous essays on pessimism and the wisdom of life |

## Relevance to My Thinking

Schopenhauer's voluntarism – the primacy of will over intellect – anticipates contemporary views in cognitive science that emphasize the primacy of affect and motivation over rational cognition. His analysis of the body as the "objectification of will" resonates with embodied cognition. The famous pessimism, while often caricatured, contains a deep insight: consciousness serves will, not the reverse. We are driven by forces we don't understand and rationalize post-hoc.

The connection to Eastern philosophy is significant for cross-cultural synthesis: Schopenhauer was the first major Western philosopher to seriously engage with Buddhist and Hindu thought, seeing in them confirmation of his own insights about the illusory nature of individuality and the path to liberation through renunciation.

## Key Quotes

> "The world is my representation." — *The World as Will and Representation*, opening sentence

> "Life swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom." — *The World as Will and Representation*

> "Compassion is the basis of all morality." — *On the Basis of Morality*

> "The life of every individual, viewed as a whole and in general, is really a tragedy; but gone through in detail it has the character of a comedy." — *The World as Will and Representation*

> "All striving comes from lack, from a dissatisfaction with one's condition, and is thus suffering as long as it is not satisfied." — *The World as Will and Representation*

> "The effect of music is so very much more powerful and penetrating than is that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow, but music of the essence." — *The World as Will and Representation*

> "Whatever torch we kindle, and whatever space it may illuminate, our horizon will always remain encircled by the depth of night." — *The World as Will and Representation*

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[thinkers/immanuel_kant/profile|Immanuel Kant]]**: Built upon Kant's phenomenon/noumenon distinction but identified the thing-in-itself with Will. Considered himself Kant's true heir and had nothing but contempt for Hegel's "corruption" of Kantianism.

- **[[thinkers/plato/profile|Plato]]**: Adopted Plato's theory of Forms/Ideas as eternal archetypes that the Will objectifies at different grades, accessible through aesthetic contemplation.

- **[[thinkers/siddhartha_gautama/profile|Buddhism/Hinduism]]**: One of the first Western philosophers to seriously engage with Indian thought. His denial of the will parallels Buddhist nirvana; his principium individuationis parallels maya (illusion).

- **[[thinkers/friedrich_nietzsche/profile|Friedrich Nietzsche]]**: Initially deeply influenced by Schopenhauer, calling him his "educator." Later rejected pessimism and transformed "will to live" into "will to power" – affirmation rather than negation of life.

- **Richard Wagner**: Profoundly influenced by Schopenhauer's aesthetics, especially the theory of music. *Tristan und Isolde* is an explicit musical realization of Schopenhauer's philosophy. (Ironically, Schopenhauer disliked Wagner's music.)

- **Sigmund Freud**: The unconscious will that dominates conscious reason anticipates Freud's id. Schopenhauer's analysis of sexual drive as the most powerful manifestation of will prefigures libido theory.

- **[[thinkers/ludwig_wittgenstein/profile|Ludwig Wittgenstein]]**: Deeply influenced by Schopenhauer's mystical concluding sections about the limits of representation.

- **G.W.F. Hegel**: Bitter enemy. Schopenhauer scheduled competing lectures and spent decades attacking Hegel as a charlatan who corrupted philosophy.
