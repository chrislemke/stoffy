# Thinker Profile: Augustine of Hippo

**Type**: philosopher, theologian
**Era**: medieval (354-430 CE)
**Traditions**: Christian Philosophy, Neoplatonism, Augustinianism

## Core Ideas

- **Original Sin**: Humanity inherits a sinful nature from Adam; all humans are born with a predisposition toward sin
- **Divine Grace**: Salvation requires God's grace; humans cannot achieve righteousness through their own efforts alone
- **Free Will and Predestination**: Human free will exists but operates within divine providence; God's foreknowledge does not negate human choice
- **The Problem of Evil**: Evil is not a substance but the absence of good (privatio boni); evil results from the misuse of free will
- **The Two Cities**: Human history is the story of the City of God (oriented toward divine love) and the City of Man (oriented toward self-love)
- **Interiority**: Truth is found within the soul; "In interiore homine habitat veritas" (Truth dwells in the inner person)
