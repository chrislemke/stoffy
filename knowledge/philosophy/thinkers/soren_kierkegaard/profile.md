# Thinker Profile: Soren Kierkegaard

**Type**: Philosopher, Theologian
**Era**: Modern (1813-1855)
**Traditions**: Existentialism, Christian Existentialism

## Core Ideas

- **Subjectivity is Truth**: Against Hegelian objective systems, Kierkegaard insisted that truth is found in subjective, passionate engagement with existence. What matters is not what one knows abstractly but how one lives and relates to truth.

- **The Three Stages of Existence**: Life progresses through three qualitatively distinct spheres - the Aesthetic (pursuit of pleasure and immediacy), the Ethical (commitment to duty and universal moral law), and the Religious (personal relationship with God through faith).

- **The Leap of Faith**: Moving between stages requires a qualitative leap that cannot be mediated by reason alone. The leap to the religious stage involves embracing the absurd - believing despite rational impossibility.

- **Angst (Anxiety/Dread)**: Anxiety is the dizzying experience of freedom - the awareness of infinite possibility before choice. It reveals our fundamental freedom and responsibility for who we become.

- **The Single Individual**: Against the crowd mentality of his age, Kierkegaard championed authentic individual existence. Becoming oneself requires breaking from the anonymous "public" and taking personal responsibility.

- **Despair and the Self**: In "The Sickness Unto Death," despair is analyzed as a failure to properly relate to oneself - either by not wanting to be oneself or by defiantly willing to be oneself without acknowledging one's grounding in the eternal.

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| Either/Or | 1843 | Presents the aesthetic and ethical stages of existence through contrasting pseudonymous voices |
| Fear and Trembling | 1843 | Analyzes Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac to explore faith as a paradoxical leap beyond ethics |
| The Concept of Anxiety | 1844 | Psychological analysis of anxiety as the precondition of sin and the experience of freedom |
| Concluding Unscientific Postscript | 1846 | Comprehensive statement of his philosophy opposing Hegelian speculation with subjective truth |
| The Sickness Unto Death | 1849 | Phenomenology of despair as the failure to properly constitute the self in relation to God |

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards." - Kierkegaard

> "Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom." - Kierkegaard

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **G.W.F. Hegel**: Kierkegaard's philosophy is fundamentally a reaction against Hegelian systematic philosophy. Where Hegel sought to comprehend everything through rational mediation, Kierkegaard insisted on the irreducible singularity of individual existence.

- **Socrates**: Kierkegaard admired Socrates' ironic method and personal engagement with truth. His dissertation was on the concept of irony in Socrates, and he saw himself as a Socratic figure for his age.

- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: Though Sartre developed an atheistic existentialism, he inherited Kierkegaard's emphasis on anxiety, freedom, radical choice, and authentic individual existence.

- **Martin Heidegger**: Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety, death, and authentic existence profoundly influenced Heidegger's existential analytic in Being and Time.
