# Thinker Profile: Plato

**Type**: philosopher
**Era**: ancient (c. 428-348 BCE)
**Traditions**: Platonism, Idealism, Classical Greek Philosophy

## Core Ideas

- **Theory of Forms (Ideas)**: Reality consists of eternal, unchanging, perfect Forms; the physical world is merely shadows or imperfect copies of these Forms
- **Allegory of the Cave**: Prisoners mistaking shadows for reality symbolize humanity's condition; philosophy liberates us to see true reality
- **Tripartite Soul**: The soul consists of reason, spirit, and appetite; justice is the proper harmony of these parts
- **Philosopher-Kings**: The ideal state should be ruled by philosophers who have knowledge of the Good
- **Platonic Love**: Love begins with attraction to physical beauty but ascends toward the Form of Beauty itself
