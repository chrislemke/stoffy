# Thinker Profile: John Stuart Mill

**Type**: Philosopher, Political Economist, Member of Parliament
**Era**: Modern (1806-1873)
**Traditions**: Utilitarianism, Classical Liberalism, Empiricism

## Core Ideas

- **Refined Utilitarianism**: The greatest happiness principle - actions are right insofar as they promote happiness and wrong as they produce unhappiness. Mill distinguished higher (intellectual) from lower (bodily) pleasures, famously stating it is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.

- **The Harm Principle**: The only legitimate reason for society to exercise power over an individual against their will is to prevent harm to others. One's own good is not sufficient warrant for interference - this is the foundation of liberal political philosophy.

- **Individual Liberty**: Freedom of thought, speech, and action is essential for human flourishing and the discovery of truth. Society benefits from diversity of opinion and experiments in living; conformity stifles progress.

- **Empiricism and Induction**: All knowledge derives from experience. Mill systematized inductive logic with his "Methods" for discovering causal relationships, providing a foundation for scientific methodology.

- **Feminist Philosophy**: In "The Subjection of Women," Mill argued that the subordination of women was wrong in principle and a hindrance to human improvement. He advocated for women's suffrage and equal rights.

- **Soft Determinism (Compatibilism)**: While our characters are formed by circumstances, we have the power to alter our characters through education and effort. Freedom is compatible with causal determination.

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way." - Mill

> "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied." - Mill

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Jeremy Bentham**: Mill's godfather and intellectual predecessor. Mill inherited and refined Bentham's utilitarianism, adding the qualitative distinction between pleasures that Bentham's purely quantitative hedonism lacked.

- **Harriet Taylor Mill**: Mill's wife and intellectual partner. He credited her with major contributions to his work, especially on women's rights and individual liberty. Their collaboration represents one of philosophy's great intellectual partnerships.

- **Auguste Comte**: Mill corresponded extensively with Comte and was initially sympathetic to positivism, though he later criticized Comte's authoritarianism. Comte influenced Mill's empiricism and philosophy of science.

- **John Rawls**: Mill's liberalism profoundly influenced 20th-century political philosophy. Rawls' theory of justice can be seen as an attempt to ground liberal principles in contractarian rather than utilitarian foundations.
