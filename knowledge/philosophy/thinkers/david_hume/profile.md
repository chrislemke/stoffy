# Thinker Profile: David Hume

**Type**: Philosopher
**Era**: Modern (1711-1776)
**Traditions**: Empiricism, Philosophical Skepticism, Naturalism, Moral Sentimentalism

## Core Ideas

- **The Problem of Induction**: We cannot rationally justify inductive reasoning. Our belief that the future will resemble the past is based on custom and habit, not reason. This challenges the foundations of empirical science and causal inference.

- **Causation as Constant Conjunction**: We never perceive causation itself, only the constant conjunction of events. Our idea of necessary connection between cause and effect arises from the habit of observing repeated correlations, not from perceiving any real power in nature.

- **The Bundle Theory of Self**: There is no enduring self or soul. What we call the self is merely a bundle of perceptions in constant flux, connected by resemblance, contiguity, and cause-effect relations. The belief in a unified self is a fiction produced by imagination.

- **Reason as Slave of the Passions**: Reason alone cannot motivate action. It can inform us about means to ends but cannot determine ends themselves. Passions (desires, emotions) are the ultimate source of human motivation, and reason serves them.

- **Moral Sentimentalism**: Morality is grounded in sentiment, not reason. We judge actions as virtuous or vicious based on the feelings of approval or disapproval they arouse in us, particularly feelings associated with utility and agreeableness.

- **The Is-Ought Problem**: One cannot derive normative conclusions (what ought to be) from purely descriptive premises (what is). This distinction between facts and values has been enormously influential in metaethics and moral philosophy.

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| *A Treatise of Human Nature* | 1739-40 | His ambitious first work presenting a systematic science of human nature; addresses understanding, passions, and morals |
| *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* | 1748 | Refined, accessible presentation of his epistemology; includes famous discussion of miracles |
| *An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals* | 1751 | His preferred work on ethics; argues for sentimentalism and utility as basis of moral judgment |
| *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* | 1779 (posthumous) | Devastating critique of the argument from design and rational theology |

## Relevance to My Thinking

Hume's skepticism about causation and induction forces a confrontation with the limits of human knowledge. His naturalistic approach to human nature anticipates modern psychology and cognitive science. The is-ought distinction remains essential for thinking clearly about ethics.

## Key Quotes

> "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them." - *A Treatise of Human Nature* (1739)

> "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence." - *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* (1748)

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **John Locke**: Hume extended Lockean empiricism to its skeptical conclusions, pushing the rejection of innate ideas further to undermine the self, causation, and induction.

- **Immanuel Kant**: Credited Hume with awakening him from his "dogmatic slumbers." Kant's critical philosophy is largely a response to Humean skepticism, attempting to salvage knowledge while accepting Hume's critique of rationalism.

- **Adam Smith**: A close friend and fellow member of the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith's moral philosophy and economics were deeply influenced by Hume's sentimentalism and naturalistic approach.

- **A.J. Ayer**: The logical positivists saw Hume as a predecessor for their empiricist, anti-metaphysical philosophy. Ayer's emotivism in ethics explicitly builds on Humean sentimentalism.

## My Notes

### 2025-12-25 - Initial Profile

Hume was remarkably cheerful and sociable despite his devastating philosophical skepticism. His philosophy represents perhaps the most thorough working out of empiricist principles, revealing their skeptical implications. His influence on Kant alone makes him central to the history of philosophy.
