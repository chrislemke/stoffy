# Thinker Profile: Thomas Parr

**Type**: neuroscientist / clinician
**Era**: contemporary
**Institutions**: Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL (Postdoctoral Scholar)
**Traditions**: Computational Neuroscience, Predictive Processing, Active Inference

## Core Ideas

Thomas Parr is a leading figure in the active inference community, co-authoring the definitive textbook with Giovanni Pezzulo and Karl Friston. His work focuses on:

- **Clinical applications of active inference**: Bridging theoretical neuroscience with clinical practice
- **Mathematical accessibility**: Making the Free Energy Principle accessible to broader audiences
- **Perception and action integration**: Formalizing the unity of sensing and acting

## Key Works

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| Active Inference (with Pezzulo & Friston) | 2022 | First comprehensive textbook on active inference |
| Multiple papers on FEP applications | Various | Extending FEP to clinical and psychological domains |

## Relevance to My Thinking

As co-author of the Active Inference textbook, Parr helped create the accessible introduction to Friston's framework that I engage with. His clinical background grounds the theoretical work in practical application.

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **[[thinkers/karl_friston/profile|Karl Friston]]**: Primary collaborator and mentor
- **[[thinkers/giovanni_pezzulo/profile|Giovanni Pezzulo]]**: Co-author of Active Inference

## My Notes

### 2025-12-26 - Initial Profile Creation
Created as part of integrating "Active Inference" into the philosophical thought system. Parr serves as a bridge between Friston's technical work and broader accessibility.
