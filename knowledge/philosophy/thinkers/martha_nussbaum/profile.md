# Thinker Profile: Martha Nussbaum

**Type**: philosopher
**Era**: Contemporary (1947-)
**Traditions**: Capabilities Approach, Virtue Ethics, Aristotelianism, Social Liberalism, Analytic Philosophy

## Core Ideas

- **The Capabilities Approach**: Justice should be measured not by resources or utility, but by what people are actually able to do and be. A dignified human life requires certain fundamental capabilities, and governments must ensure at least a threshold level of each.

- **Ten Central Human Capabilities**: Life; bodily health; bodily integrity; senses, imagination, and thought; emotions; practical reason; affiliation; other species; play; control over one's environment (political and material). These constitute the minimum requirements for human dignity.

- **The Fragility of Goodness**: Human flourishing is vulnerable to forces beyond our control - fortune, circumstance, the actions of others. The ancient Greeks understood this; it does not diminish the importance of virtue but shapes how we understand the good life.

- **Emotions as Intelligent Judgments**: Emotions are not mere feelings but cognitive appraisals that ascribe importance to external things for our flourishing. Understanding emotions as judgments allows us to integrate them into ethical theory.

- **Neo-Stoic Theory of Emotions**: While drawing on Stoic analysis of emotions as evaluative judgments, Nussbaum rejects Stoic extirpation of emotions. Love, grief, and compassion contain important truths about human vulnerability and connection.

- **Liberal Feminism and Global Justice**: Liberalism, properly understood, requires radical transformation of gender relations and family structures. The capabilities approach reveals how women worldwide are denied conditions for fully human lives.

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "To be a good human being is to have a kind of openness to the world, an ability to trust uncertain things beyond your own control." - *The Fragility of Goodness*

> "Capabilities are not just abilities residing inside a person but also the freedoms or opportunities created by a combination of personal abilities and the political, social, and economic environment." - *Creating Capabilities*

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Aristotle**: Nussbaum's philosophical foundation; her capabilities approach draws on Aristotelian virtue ethics and the idea of human flourishing (eudaimonia) while updating it for modern liberal democracies.

- **Amartya Sen**: Close collaborator in developing the capabilities approach; while Sen emphasizes comparative assessments and resists defining a fixed list of capabilities, Nussbaum specifies ten central capabilities as constitutional guarantees.

- **John Rawls**: Nussbaum engages critically with Rawlsian liberalism, arguing that the social contract framework cannot adequately address disability, global justice, or animal ethics - problems she addresses through capabilities.

- **John Stuart Mill**: Nussbaum draws on Mill's liberal feminism and his rich conception of utility, which includes qualitative distinctions between pleasures and emphasizes development of human faculties.
