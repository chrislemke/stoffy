# Thinker Profile: David C. Krakauer

**Type**: Complexity Scientist / Evolutionary Biologist
**Era**: Contemporary (born December 28, 1967)
**Institutions**: Santa Fe Institute (President since 2015), William H. Miller Professor of Complex Systems
**Traditions**: Complexity Science, Evolutionary Biology, Information Theory, Collective Computation

## Biography

### Early Life and Education
David C. Krakauer was born on December 28, 1967, in Hawaii. He grew up in southern Portugal and moved to London for secondary school. He attended Royal Holloway, University of London, where he earned degrees in computer science and mathematics. He received his DPhil in evolutionary theory from Oxford University in 1995, under the supervision of Alasdair Houston and Mark Pagel.

### Academic Career
After his doctorate, Krakauer remained at Oxford as a Wellcome Research Fellow in mathematical biology and lecturer at Pembroke College. In 1999, he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and served as visiting professor of evolution at Princeton University.

At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he served as the founding director of the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, co-director of the Center for Complexity and Collective Computation, and professor of mathematical genetics.

### Santa Fe Institute Leadership
Since 2015, Krakauer has served as President and William H. Miller Professor of Complex Systems at the Santa Fe Institute. He previously served as the institute's faculty chair and as both a resident and external professor. He co-directs the Collective Computation Group (C4) at SFI and serves as Editor-in-Chief of SFI Press.

### Recognition
- 2012: Included in *Wired* Magazine Smart List as one of 50 people "who will change the world"
- 2016: Included in *Entrepreneur* Magazine's visionary leaders advancing global research and business

## Core Ideas

### 1. The Four Pillars of Complexity
Complexity science emerges from the synthesis of four foundational areas: **evolution** (adaptation, selection, fitness), **entropy** (thermodynamics, information theory), **dynamics** (nonlinear systems, chaos, attractors), and **computation** (information processing, algorithmic complexity). These pillars interconnect to form a unified framework for understanding complex adaptive systems.

### 2. Emergence
Novel properties that arise from interactions between components but cannot be reduced to those components. Emergence creates genuine ontological levels—the whole is not just greater than the sum of parts but *different*. This is not mere epistemological limitation but ontological novelty.

### 3. Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)
Systems composed of interacting agents that learn and adapt. Unlike merely complicated systems (with many parts but predictable behavior), complex systems exhibit emergent, unpredictable behavior. Examples: immune systems, ecosystems, markets, cities, brains.

### 4. Problem-Solving Matter
Living and cognitive systems differ fundamentally from abiotic matter—they solve problems. Natural selection and learning create systems that "compute" solutions to environmental challenges. Purpose and function are real features of complex adaptive systems.

### 5. Collective Computation
Groups of agents can process information in ways that no individual agent can. Ant colonies, neural networks, markets, and scientific communities all exhibit collective intelligence. This explains how minds might emerge from neurons and societies from individuals.

### 6. The Purposeful Universe
By combining evolution, entropy, dynamics, and computation, complexity science reveals how purpose and meaning can emerge naturally in a physical universe. Teleology is not illusory but an emergent property of complex systems.

| Work | Year | Key Contribution |
|------|------|------------------|
| *The Complex World: An Introduction to the Foundations of Complexity Science* | 2024 | Comprehensive introduction tracing complexity science from 19th-century science of machines to 20th-century emergent systems; 608 pages |
| *Foundational Papers in Complexity Science* (4 volumes) | 2024 | Edited anthology of 89 seminal papers (1922-2000) with scholarly commentary; curated by Krakauer as SFI Press Editor-in-Chief |
| "Degeneracy and complexity in biological systems" | 2004 | Seminal paper on degeneracy (multiple solutions to same problem) as key to robustness |
| "The evolution of gene expression and the transcriptome–phenotype relationship" | Various | Work on how genetic regulatory systems process information |
| Research on "exbodiment" | Ongoing | Studies on how intelligence is enhanced and outsourced through languages and artifacts |

### Research Focus

Krakauer's research explores the fundamental character of "problem-solving matter." This spans:
- Origin of life and evolution of intelligence (and stupidity)
- Processes of "exbodiment" through which intelligence is outsourced using languages and artifacts
- Evolution of genetic, neural, linguistic, social, and cultural mechanisms supporting memory and information processing
- How information is acquired, stored, transmitted, robustly encoded, and processed at each level

## Relevance to My Thinking

Krakauer's framework provides a meta-language for integrating my diverse philosophical explorations:

1. **Emergence as Nichten**: The concept of emergence maps onto my "Vernichtung als Methode" thought. Emergence transcends binary opposition—it is neither reduction nor holism but a third way. When properties emerge, the lower level is neither preserved nor destroyed but *aufgehoben* (sublated in Hegelian terms).

2. **Complexity and Potentiality**: Complex adaptive systems embody potentiality in a formal sense. A CAS is defined by its adaptive capacity—its ability to respond to perturbations. This is potentiality made computational.

3. **Edge of chaos**: The concept of operating at "the edge of chaos" resonates with my edge-dynamics model in Existentielle Potenzialität. At the edge, categories dissolve and reform—the system is poised in creative tension.

4. **Self-organization and selfhood**: If order can arise without central control, the self might be such an emergent, self-organized pattern.

## Key Quotes

> "We live in a complex world—meaning one that is increasingly connected, evolving, technological, volatile, and potentially poised for catastrophe."

> "Complexity science provides the first scientific framework for understanding the purposeful universe."

> "Emergence is not mere unexpectedness but genuine ontological novelty."

## My Notes

### 2025-12-26 - Initial Profile Creation
Created as part of integrating "The Complex World" into the philosophical thought system. Krakauer provides the widest lens—a framework for understanding reality as complex, adaptive, and emergent. This positions my other explorations (flat mind, active inference, potentiality) as aspects of a unified complexity-theoretic worldview.

### 2025-12-31 - Major Enhancement
Added comprehensive biography (education, career, SFI leadership), updated key works with 2024 publications (The Complex World, Foundational Papers 4-volume set), research focus section, expanded thinker connections, and Further Reading with podcasts and online resources.
