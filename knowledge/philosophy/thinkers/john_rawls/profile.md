# Thinker Profile: John Rawls

**Type**: philosopher
**Era**: Contemporary (1921-2002)
**Traditions**: Liberalism, Contractarianism, Analytic Philosophy, Social Liberalism

## Core Ideas

- **Justice as Fairness**: Justice is fundamentally about fairness in the distribution of rights, opportunities, and resources. A just society is one whose basic structure would be chosen by free and equal persons under fair conditions of deliberation.

- **The Original Position and Veil of Ignorance**: A thought experiment where rational agents choose principles of justice without knowing their place in society, their natural abilities, or conception of the good. This "veil of ignorance" ensures impartiality and prevents self-interested bargaining.

- **Two Principles of Justice**: (1) Equal basic liberties for all citizens; (2) Social and economic inequalities must be arranged to benefit the least advantaged (the Difference Principle) and attached to positions open to all under fair equality of opportunity.

- **Reflective Equilibrium**: A method of moral reasoning that seeks coherence between our considered moral judgments, moral principles, and background theories, adjusting each in light of the others until they form a stable, coherent whole.

- **Political Liberalism and Overlapping Consensus**: In pluralistic societies, political principles should be justifiable to citizens with diverse comprehensive doctrines. Stability comes from an overlapping consensus among reasonable comprehensive views, not from imposing a single worldview.

- **Public Reason**: In matters of basic justice and constitutional essentials, citizens should appeal to political values and principles that all reasonable citizens can accept, not to their particular religious or philosophical doctrines.

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought." - *A Theory of Justice*

> "In justice as fairness, society is interpreted as a cooperative venture for mutual advantage." - *A Theory of Justice*

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Immanuel Kant**: Rawls's theory is deeply Kantian, treating persons as ends in themselves and grounding justice in what free and rational agents would choose. The veil of ignorance operationalizes Kantian universalizability.

- **John Locke**: Rawls updates the social contract tradition, though replacing Locke's state of nature with the original position and focusing on distributive rather than merely procedural justice.

- **Thomas Nagel**: Rawls's student; developed related work on equality and the view from nowhere, while raising challenges about the limits of political liberalism.

- **Robert Nozick**: Harvard colleague and friendly critic; *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* offers a libertarian alternative to Rawlsian distributive justice, sparking decades of debate.
