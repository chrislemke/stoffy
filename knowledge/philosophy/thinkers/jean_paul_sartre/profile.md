# Thinker Profile: Jean-Paul Sartre

**Type**: Philosopher, Playwright, Novelist
**Era**: Contemporary (1905-1980)
**Traditions**: Existentialism, Phenomenology, Western Marxism

## Core Ideas

- **Existence Precedes Essence**: Humans have no predetermined nature or purpose. We exist first and define ourselves through our choices and actions. There is no human nature that dictates what we must be.

- **Radical Freedom**: Humans are "condemned to be free" - we cannot escape the burden of choosing. Even refusing to choose is itself a choice. Freedom is absolute and inescapable.

- **Bad Faith (Mauvaise Foi)**: The self-deceptive denial of our freedom by pretending we have no choice or by hiding behind social roles. We flee from the anxiety of freedom into comfortable self-delusion.

- **Being-for-itself vs. Being-in-itself**: Consciousness (for-itself) is characterized by nothingness, negation, and the ability to transcend given situations. Objects (in-itself) simply are what they are without self-awareness.

- **The Look and Being-for-Others**: The gaze of the Other transforms us into objects, revealing our vulnerability and the inherent conflict in human relationships. This leads to Sartre's famous claim that "Hell is other people."

- **Commitment and Engagement**: Authentic existence requires active engagement with the world, taking responsibility for one's choices and recognizing that in choosing for oneself, one chooses for all humanity.

## Relevance to My Thinking

[Personal reflection to be added]

## Key Quotes

> "Existence precedes essence." - Existentialism Is a Humanism

> "Man is condemned to be free." - Existentialism Is a Humanism

## Connections to Other Thinkers

- **Simone de Beauvoir**: Lifelong partner and collaborator who developed existentialist ethics and feminist philosophy. They profoundly influenced each other's thought.

- **Martin Heidegger**: Major philosophical influence, though Sartre developed phenomenology in a more humanistic and politically engaged direction.

- **Edmund Husserl**: Sartre studied Husserl's phenomenology in Berlin (1933-34), adapting the phenomenological method for existentialist purposes.

- **Albert Camus**: Initially close friend and fellow resistance member, though they later had a famous public falling out over political and philosophical differences.
