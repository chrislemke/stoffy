# Self-Reference, State, and Computational Truth

## Initial Spark

Exploration of the relationship between self-reference, contradiction, and computability as a criterion for truth. Key insight: mathematics has no state, computers have state. In a self-referencing Fibonacci function, there is state/context outside the function, stored in machine memory. This raises fundamental questions about whether a sentence can truly refer to itself—is a sentence only complete when it ends?

Saul Kripke's distinction between grounded and ungrounded statements offers a formal approach to semantic antinomies. But is banning self-reference the right approach? Perhaps the issue is more specifically *negative* self-reference that creates inherent contradiction.

## Current Position

The thesis "Only that which can be computed can be accepted as true" offers a precise and objective standard for determining truth. Computation aligns with the scientific method and allows for predictions. However, this position faces serious counterexamples: subjective experiences like pain and beauty cannot be expressed in formal language or processed by a computer, yet they are generally considered real and true experiences.

This suggests a fundamental tension between formal/computational approaches to truth and phenomenological reality.

## Supporting Arguments

1. **Computation provides objectivity**: If a statement can be expressed in a formal language and processed by a computer, it meets a clear standard for truth
2. **Predictive power**: Computation allows accurate predictions about the world, strengthening our understanding of reality
3. **Scientific method alignment**: The scientific method relies heavily on computation—experiments involve data analysis, theories are expressed in formal languages

## Challenges & Objections

- **Objection**: Subjective experience (pain, beauty) cannot be formalized yet is considered true
  - **Response**: This may indicate limits of computational truth rather than its invalidity—perhaps truth is multi-modal

- **Objection**: Some computable statements are known to be false
  - **Response**: Computability is necessary but not sufficient; validity checking is also required

- **Objection**: Can a sentence truly refer to itself? The sentence is only complete when it ends
  - **Response**: This is the core question—perhaps "self-reference" in language is fundamentally different from recursion in computation (which has external state)

## Open Questions

- [ ] Ist das Verbot der Selbstbezüglichkeit bei der semantischen Antinomie ein passender Ansatz?
- [ ] Was bedeutet self-reference in der Mathematik vs. Computerwissenschaften?
- [ ] Was ist die Bedeutung von Unendlichkeiten im Bezug auf Widersprüche?
- [ ] Woher kommt das Konzept der "self-reference"? Ist es ein menschliches Konzept, das der Hoffnung nach einem Selbst entsprungen ist?
- [ ] Kann sich ein Satz wirklich auf sich selbst beziehen? Ist der Satz nicht erst fertig, wenn er beendet ist?
- [ ] How does Kripke's grounded/ungrounded distinction relate to the state/stateless distinction in computation?

## Related Ideas

- **Existentielle Potenzialität**: Both explorations share a concern with the limits of formalization—what escapes capture? Potentiality in one case, subjective experience in the other.

## Philosophical Connections

### Thinker Connections

- **[[thinkers/ludwig_wittgenstein/profile|Ludwig Wittgenstein]]** (strong): The questioning of whether a sentence can "truly refer to itself" directly echoes Wittgenstein's analysis of language games and his Tractatus thesis that language cannot meaningfully speak about itself. His "showing vs. saying" distinction illuminates why the liar paradox may be a category error.

- **[[thinkers/nagarjuna/profile|Nagarjuna]]** (strong): The analysis of self-reference as "intrinsically infinite" resonates with Nagarjuna's prasanga method of exposing contradictions. His tetralemma (neither exists, nor not-exists, nor both, nor neither) offers a framework beyond simple banning of self-reference.

- **[[thinkers/immanuel_kant/profile|Immanuel Kant]]** (strong): The exploration of contradictions arising from self-reference parallels Kant's Antinomies of Pure Reason—where reason ventures beyond its proper bounds and generates irresolvable contradictions.

- **[[thinkers/georg_hegel/profile|G.W.F. Hegel]]** (strong): The treatment of contradiction as generative resonates with Hegel's dialectical method where contradiction drives conceptual development. The "true infinite" for Hegel is precisely self-referential.

- **[[thinkers/thomas_nagel/profile|Thomas Nagel]]** (strong): The counterexamples to computational truth (pain, beauty as unformalizable yet true) directly engage Nagel's thesis about the irreducibly subjective character of experience.

- **[[thinkers/aristotle/profile|Aristotle]]** (moderate): Aristotle's distinction between potentiality and actuality, and his founding of formal logic, provides foundational vocabulary for discussing how mathematical concepts differ from computational implementations with state.

- **[[thinkers/rene_descartes/profile|Rene Descartes]]** (moderate): The inquiry into subjective experience as counter-example to computational truth echoes Descartes' cogito—the one certainty that survives radical doubt is an unformalizable first-person experience.

- **[[thinkers/daniel_dennett/profile|Daniel Dennett]]** (moderate): Dennett's work on recursion, self-reference, and consciousness (with Hofstadter on "strange loops") directly addresses computational aspects of self-reference.

- **[[thinkers/nick_chater/profile|Nick Chater]]** (moderate): Chaters These der seriellen Verarbeitung - ein Gedanke nach dem anderen - wirft Fragen für selbstreferentielle Schleifen auf. Wenn bewusstes Denken strikt seriell ist, wie kann ein Satz sich während seiner eigenen Äußerung auf sich beziehen? Der flache Geist könnte die Unmöglichkeit echter Selbstreferenz auf der bewussten Ebene implizieren.

- **[[thinkers/karl_friston/profile|Karl Friston]]** (moderate): Aktive Inferenz als Wahrheitssuche: Der bayesianische Rahmen schlägt vor, dass Kognition darauf abzielt, Vorhersagefehler zu minimieren - eine Form der Wahrheitsannäherung. Aber kann dieser computationale Ansatz phänomenologische Wahrheit (Schmerz, Schönheit) erfassen? Die Spannung zwischen formaler und erlebter Wahrheit bleibt bestehen.

### Thought Connections

- **[[thoughts/existence/2025-12-25_existentielle_potenzialitaet/]]** (moderate): Both explorations share a concern with the limits of formalization. Existentielle Potenzialität asks whether existence can be captured in actualized properties; this content asks whether truth can be captured in computation. Both find that something escapes.

### Analysis Summary

This content presents a sophisticated inquiry into the foundations of truth, self-reference, and computability. Its core philosophical significance lies in the tension between Kripke's grounded/ungrounded distinction (formal-logical approach) and the phenomenological challenge that subjective experiences like pain constitute truths that resist any formalization. The question "where does the concept of self-reference come from?" reveals a deeper genealogical dimension connecting language, logic, and lived experience.

## Evolution of This Thought

### 2025-12-26 - Initial Spark

Captured initial reflections on the relationship between self-reference in mathematics vs. computation, questioning whether sentences can truly self-refer, and exploring computational criteria for truth with subjective experience as counterexample.

### Next Steps

- Explore Kripke's "Outline of a Theory of Truth" in depth
- Consider creating a thinker profile for Saul Kripke
- Develop the distinction between mathematical and computational self-reference
- Investigate connection to modal logic and intuitionistic logic (mentioned in existentielle_potenzialitaet)
