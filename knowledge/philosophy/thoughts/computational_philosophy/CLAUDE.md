This folder explores the application of **software development patterns to philosophical thought management**—a meta-philosophical investigation into how tools like unit testing, debugging, CI/CD, and LLM agents can enhance philosophical work.

## Purpose

- Investigate how software engineering patterns can be adapted for philosophy
- Explore the computational structure underlying philosophical thought
- Develop practical tools for digitally managed philosophy projects
- Examine human-AI collaboration in philosophical development

## Key Themes

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Structural validation, consistency checking, regression testing for arguments |
| **Debugging** | Hidden assumption detection, stack traces to premises, concept tracking |
| **CI/CD** | Automated pipelines for thought commits, LLM-assisted review |
| **Agent Collaboration** | Multi-agent philosophical development workflows |
| **Dependency Management** | Thought graphs, circular detection, impact analysis |
| **Version Control** | Position branches, worldview releases, philosophical merges |

## Critical Insight

**Code vs. Philosophy**: Tests FLAG rather than FAIL. Detected tensions might be productive dialectical resources, not bugs to fix. Human judgment remains central—tools ASSIST, not REPLACE.

## Related Repository Components

- LLM Agents: `../../.claude/agents/` (analyst, generator, symposiarch, devils-advocate)
- Existing patterns: YAML frontmatter, hierarchical indices, bidirectional linking
- Scripts: `../../scripts/` for automation examples

## Memory Files

Files in this folder can have `_memory.md` companions with **higher weight**. When processing any file, check for and apply memory file corrections first.
