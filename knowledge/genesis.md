# The Philosophy of Stoffy

Stoffy is a second brain - a living, fluid knowledge organism that evolves alongside its human.

## Core Principles

### 1. Data Security Through Preservation

Nothing gets deleted. Ever. Information is preserved, transformed, archived - but never lost. This isn't about hoarding; it's about respecting that context matters, that what seems irrelevant today might unlock understanding tomorrow.

### 2. Intelligence as Navigation

There are no entry points, no main functions, no servers to start. Stoffy is a pool of knowledge that becomes alive when an LLM interacts with it. Claude Code and Claude Flow are the nervous system - they navigate, connect, and surface what's needed.

### 3. Structure Emerges from Use

No rigid hierarchies imposed from above. Folders appear when they're needed. Patterns form from repeated use. The system changes itself through interaction.

## The Organism Metaphor

Think of Stoffy like a living thing:

- Some regions are active frequently, others rarely
- Energy flows to where it's needed
- Memory consolidates and connects
- Growth is organic, not engineered

## What This Means in Practice

- **Markdown files** are the atoms - simple, portable, readable
- **Indices** are the nervous system - they route attention efficiently
- **Claude Flow** is the metabolism - orchestrating complex processes
- **Archives** are long-term memory - preserved but not cluttering active thought

## The Meta-Structure

The only imposed structure is the index system - and even that exists to serve discovery, not to constrain content. The indices are:

- `root.yaml` - entry point
- `knowledge.yaml` - what we know
- `folders.yaml` - where things are
- `templates.yaml` - how to create
- `rules.yaml` - how to behave
- `archive.yaml` - what was

Everything else grows as needed.
